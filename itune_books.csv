"Charles Barkley has never been shy about expressing his opinions. Michael Jordan once said that we all want to say the things that Barkley says, but we don’t dare. But even die-hard followers of the all-time NBA great, the star of TNT’s Inside the NBA and CNN’s TalkBack Live, will be astonished by just how candid and provocative he is in this book—and just how big his ambitions are. Though he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh, there’s nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here—not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. “Early on,” says Washington Post columnist and ESPN talk show host Michael Wilbon in his Introduction, “Barkley made his peace with mixing it up, and decided the consequences were very much worth it to him. And that makes him as radically different in these modern celebrity times as a 6-foot-4-inch power forward.”If there’s one thing Charles Barkley knows, it’s the crying need for honest, open discussion in this country—the more uncomfortable the subject, the more necessary the dialogue. And if the discussion leader can be as wise, irreverent, (occasionally) profane and (consistently) funny as Charles Barkley, so much the better. Many people are going to be shocked and scandalized by I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It, but many more will stand up and cheer. Like Molly Ivins or Bill O’Reilly, Charles Barkley is utterly his own thinker, and everything he says comes from deep reflection. One way or another, if more blood hasn’t reached your brain by the time you’ve finished this book, maybe you’ve been embalmed.From the Hardcover edition.",4.0,$11.99,Basketball,"Oct 01, 2002",420693412,Random House Publishing Group,English,I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/i-may-be-wrong-but-i-doubt-it/id420693412?mt=11,4.19048,Charles Barkley & Michael Wilbon,"Random House, LLC",288 Pages,

"Virginia Tech’s Shayne Graham trots onto the field at West Virginia on November 6, 1999, with two thoughts in his mind. One is a missed field goal that would have beaten Miami a year earlier. The other is the 44-yard field goal he is about to try against the Mountaineers, a kick he must make if the Hokies are to stay unbeaten and on track for a national championship. Head down, he focuses on his mark as the ball is snapped. He steps forward, the dream of an entire team resting with his leg. Now, hear Graham’s memory of that kick in his own words, for the first time. Game of My Life: Virginia Tech Hokies, first published in 2006, celebrates the extraordinary football and basketball moments that have shaped the college’s rich athletic heritage. Through interviews with some of the school’s most prestigious athletes, Hokies fans can relive the big games that defined the school’s winning tradition.Carroll Dale, later a fixture with the Green Bay Packers, dovearms outstretchedto haul in a crucial two-point conversion in a 1957 game against the University of Richmond. Les Henson shot from the baselinethe other baselineas the clock neared zero against Florida State in 1980. Chris Smith went well beyond the ""double-double"" standard for points and rebounds. How about 30 and 31 against Marshall in 1959? Corey Moore made life miserable for Clemson quarterback Brandon Streeter one night in 1999. Bruce Smith did the same for Duke quarterback Ben Bennett in 1983. The Hokies’ Jim Pyne, meanwhile, made sure Syracuse’s Kevin Mitchell didn’t do the same to Tech quarterback Maurice DeShazo in 1993. Carlos Dixon, Mike Imoh, Andre Davis, Dell Curry, Bryan Still, Don Strock, Bryan Randallall the Tech greats from the gridiron and hardwoodare in these pages, including coach Frank Beamer.

"The story of Canada’s other game from its invention by a Canadian to its current struggle for popularity. Basketball, the only major world sport undeniably invented by a Canadian, has ironically failed to win Canadians’ hearts more than a century after its creation. James Naismith’s brainchild is a popular recreational pastime in his homeland, but players with bigger dreams had better take their talents south of the border. Canadian hoops has languished in the seemingly eternal shadow of hockey, with its cannibalization of air time, advertising dollars, and corporate capital.Faced with limited opportunities at home, as many as 50 teenagers flock to U.S. prep schools and colleges every year to chase their dreams of college stardom and, much less likely, a shot at glory in the NBA. Against all odds, a skinny kid from Victoria named Steve Nash managed to reach the pinnacle of the sport, with a whirling-dervish style that earned him two MVP awards in the world’s greatest league.Today, a new generation of Canadians stand poised to follow in Nash’s path. But will their success spark a renaissance back home?

"In this eBook exclusive essay, Pulitzer Prize–winning sports journalist George Dohrmann follows a father and son separated by prison bars—but bonded by their pursuit of basketball glory.   The dream of playing big-time basketball never came true for Bruce Nelson, so he passed it on to his son Roberto. His every waking moment as a father was devoted to securing Roberto a Division I scholarship. Oftentimes he worried that his son’s lack of competitive fire might put that dream in jeopardy—when in fact it was Bruce’s own actions that would do so. When Bruce is forced to monitor Roberto’s progress from behind penitentiary walls, his influence recedes—and so too does Roberto’s commitment to the aspirations they once shared. In a story that combines deep insight into family relationships with the deft storytelling that distinguished his award-winning Play Their Hearts Out, George Dohrmann follows Roberto as he addresses his life’s most difficult decisions in the absence of his best friend and most constant companion. In doing so, Dohrmann sheds new light on the larger story of basketball dreams and the pressures they place on young athletes.   Includes an excerpt from George Dohrmann’s Play Their Hearts Out, winner of the PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sportswriting and the Award for Excellence in the Coverage of Youth Sports.   Praise for Play Their Hearts Out   “Often heartbreaking, always riveting.”—The New York Times Book Review   “Tremendous.”—The Plain Dealer   “Indispensable.”—The Wall Street Journal   “A tour de force of reporting, filled with deft storytelling and vivid character studies.”—The Washington Post   “One of the finest sports books of all time.”—Harper’s Magazine   “Amazing stuff . . . the Friday Night Lights of youth basketball.”—Leigh Montville, author of The Big Bam   “A landmark achievement in basketball journalism.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)   NAMED ONE OF THE BEST SPORTS BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES • THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR • KIRKUS REVIEWS",4.0,$0.99,Basketball,"Feb 07, 2012",470465104,Random House Publishing Group,English,Hand-Me-Down Dream (Essay),https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hand-me-down-dream-essay/id470465104?mt=11,4.0,George Dohrmann,"Random House, LLC",36 Pages,"Father, Son, and the Burden of Basketball"
"“Eduard Portela, l’home de l’ACB” és l’homenatge del periodista Jaume Rius a qui va ser, durant molts anys, màxim responsable de l’Associació de Clubs de Bàsquet. També va ser jugador, entrenador i director tècnic; una vida dedicada al món de la cistella.
Hi diuen la seva sobre Portela setanta-una persones relacionades amb el món del bàsquet. L’epíleg és de la seva dona, Maria Planas, exjugadora, exentrenadora i exseleccionadora espanyola. És difícil destacar només uns quants noms, però en poso uns quants exemples. Exjugadors com Juanma Iturriaga, Nacho Solozábal, Ferran Martínez, Jordi Villacampa i Walter Szcerbiak; entrenadors de la talla d’Ettore Messina, Dusko Ivanovic, Boza Maljkovic, Aíto García Reneses i Lolo Sainz i periodistes com Joan Cerdà, Jordi Robirosa, José Manuel Fernández i el mateix Jaume Rius. Fernández, explosiu com sempre, aprofita l’avinentesa per tornar a deixar clar el seu odi visceral cap a Aíto. El seu article, s’ha de dir, és dels que té més gràcia.
També m’han cridat l’atenció les reflexions de Salvador Alemany (president de la secció de bàsquet del Barça entre 1986 i 2003), Jordi Bertomeu (president de l’Eurolliga), Yvan Mainini (president de la FIBA), Antonio Novoa (expresident del Granollers i fundador de l’ACB, al costat de Portela) i David J Stern, comissionat de l’NBA. Tothom destaca el perfil humanista de Portela, un home avançat al seu temps. L’Eduard va intuir la importància del poder de la imatge, quan només es transmetia futbol, i va portar el bàsquet a la tele. També va ser ell qui va idear que l’ACB tingués el seu propi departament d’arbitratge. Quan era màxim responsable del Barça, va ser el responsable del fitxatge de “Chicho” Sibilio.
Personalment, a Portela el vaig conèixer quan jo era un nen. Va ser en un Campus, a Berga. Jo jugava amb el Granollers i ell ja estava al capdavant del Barça, com a secretari tècnic. Recordo que ens va fer una xerrada sobre el món del bàsquet i ens va regalar un banderí del club blaugrana, signat per ell. Després, com a periodista, l’he entrevistat unes quantes vegades. A l'Olímpic de Granollers, quan jo era cap de premsa del BFI Granollers i feia de speaker als partits del primer equip, vam presentar plegats l'homenatge a Joan “Chichi” Creus que, en l'actualitat, és el màxim responsable de la secció de bàsquet del Barça.

"An inside account of NBA Commissioner David Stern's obsession with building a home for the Sacramento Kings, a tragically cursed, road-weary basketball team in Northern California.
Stern worked more than a decade to anchor the Kings in Sacramento, guiding NBA owners to reject a record-setting offer from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to move the franchise to Seattle.
Written by a veteran journalist and political staffer, who worked on the Kings' project with Stern and Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, ""Vagrant Kings"" provides an unprecedented look at Stern and the political, cultural and economic impact of the NBA on its host cities.
The author explores the special relationship between Stern and Mayor Johnson, a former NBA all-star who never forgave his home-town team in Sacramento for failing to draft him in 1987. 
The book traces the history of the Kings from their Great Depression barnstorming origins in Rochester, N.Y., and explains how they became the most migratory franchise in American major league sports. The narrative follows the team through Cincinnati, Kansas City and Omaha, on its way to California.
""Vagrant Kings"" describes the Kings' often-fractured and sometimes tragic relationships with Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, Maurice Stokes, Oscar Robertson, Danny Ainge, Dick Motta, Ron Artest, Chris Webber, Olden Polynice, Bobby Hurley, Wayman Tisdale and other NBA notables.
""The appropriate outcome"" is the phrase Stern uses when a group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, led by Vivek Ranadive, buy the Kings and vow to keep them in California, despite having been out-bid by Ballmer. Ranadive becomes the first person born in India to own an NBA franchise.
Unmatched in scope, access and reflections on the emotional, political and financial decisions that swirl around major-league sports in America, ""Vagrant Kings"" is the first book to provide a deeply personal and detailed look at how David Stern runs the NBA, and how the NBA impacts its host communities.",0.0,$8.99,Basketball,"Sep 22, 2013",713402351,R.E.

"This inspiring memoir from sports and cultural icon Bill Walton recounts his devastating injuries and amazing recoveries, set in the context of his UCLA triumphs under John Wooden, his storied NBA career, and his affinity for music and the Grateful Dead.In February 2007, Bill Walton suffered a catastrophic spinal collapse—the culmination of a lifetime of injuries—that left him unable to move. He spent three years on the floor of his house, eating his meals there and crawling to the bathroom, where he could barely hoist himself up onto the toilet. The excruciating pain and slow recovery tested Walton to the fullest. But with extraordinary patience, fortitude, determination, and sacrifice—and pioneering surgery—he recovered, and now shares his life story in this remarkable and unique memoir.Walton grew up in San Diego in the 1950s and 1960s and was deeply influenced by the political and cultural upheavals of that period. Although he strongly identified with the cool people, particularly in music and politics, his greatest role model outside his family was super-straight UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a thoughtful, rigorous mentor who seemed immune to the turmoil of the times. Although there was always tension and conflict between them, the two men would speak nearly every day for forty-three years, until Wooden’s death at age ninety-nine.Despite a lifelong stuttering affliction, Walton chose a career in broadcasting after his playing days ended. He eventually won an Emmy Award and other accolades for broadcasting and was recognized as a leading media pundit.John Wooden once said that no greatness ever came without sacrifice. Nothing better illustrates this saying than the real story of Walton’s life. In his own words, Back from the Dead shares this dramatic story, including his basketball and broadcasting careers, his many setbacks and rebounds, and his ultimate triumph as the toughest of champions.",0.0,,Biographies & Memoirs,"Mar 08, 2016",668394084,Simon & Schuster,English,Back from the Dead,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/back-from-the-dead/id668394084?mt=11,,Bill Walton,320 Pages,English,
"By embarking on a quest to dunk a basketball at the age of 34, journalist Asher Price investigates the limits of human potential—starting with his own. We all like to think that (with a little practice) we could run faster, learn another language, or whip up a perfect soufflé. But few of us ever put those hopes to the test. In Year of the Dunk, Asher Price does, and he seizes on basketball’s slam dunk--a feat richly freighted with distinctly American themes of culture, race, and upward mobility--as a gauge to determine his own hidden potential. The showmanship of the dunk mesmerized Asher as a child, but even with his height (six foot plus) and impressive wingspan, he never pushed himself to try it. Now, approaching middle age, Asher decides to spend a year remaking his body and testing his mind as he wonders, like most adults, what untapped talent he still possesses.   In this humorous and often poignant journey into the pleasures and perils of exertion, Asher introduces us to a memorable cast of characters who help him understand the complexity of the human body and the individual drama at the heart of sports. Along the way he dives into the history and science of one of sports' most exuberant acts, examining everything from our genetic predisposition towards jumping to the cultural role of the slam dunk. The year-long effort forces him to ask some fundamental questions about human ability and the degree to which we can actually improve ourselves, even with great determination.From the Hardcover edition.",0.0,$12.99,Basketball,"May 12, 2015",914371150,Crown/Archetype,English,Year of the Dunk,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/year-of-the-dunk/id914371150?mt=11,,Asher Price,"Random House, LLC",288 Pages,A Modest Defiance of Gravity
"Zach Randolph has never been lacking for talent or skill — putting the ball in the basket has always come weary to Z-Bo. The main issue early in his career was whether he could remain under-control enough emotionally to help a team. He’s answered that question convincingly now, 1 years deep into his NBA career. 
Teaming with his best supporting cast of his career in Memphis, Zach has continued to produce while seeing fewer shot attempts then he did on lesser clubs. No matter his scoring numbers (he’s averaged over 20ppg 6 times), Z-Bo has remained a rebounding machine, grabbing 10-plus boards in 8 of his 13 seasons. 
This Signature Workout Program covers some of Zach Randolph’s best skills, including:
	•	Using Spin Moves In The Post To Seal Off Defenders
	•	Scoring In The Post With Below-The-Rim Power Moves
	•	Post Footwork 
	•	Mid-Post Shooting
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over
The NBA Signature Workouts are detailed, step-by-step 30-day self-training programs created in the mold of the abilities of your favorite NBA players.

"In 1945, the Loyola New Orleans Wolf Pack became the city’s first basketball team to earn a national championship. The Cinderella season was chronicled in the Times Picayune, the student newspaper The Maroon and letters from students and alums fighting overseas. The 1944–45 run to the championship was an amazing boon to the community during trying times. The group of boyhood friends and rivals beat out previous national champions and exhausted opponents.

Durante o rigoroso inverno, quando o trabalho nas fazendas diminui, os jogos de basquete são a força vital da cidade. Se o time perde, o desânimo se instala e o frio se torna insuportável. E já se vão cinco anos sem que a equipe de Willow Creek obtenha uma vitória sequer.

"In the spring of 1995, twelve extraordinary basketball players were chosen to represent the United States in the year-long march to the 1996 Olympics. For Rebecca Lobo, Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, and their teammates, winning the gold medal was only one of many goals. Around them swirled the dreams of the millions of young girls who played organized basketball, the hopes of the fans who sent the team an average of 125 pounds of fan mail each month, the multimillion-dollar bets of Nike, Champion, and other corporate sponsors, the promise of a new women's professional league, and not least, the hopes of female athletes across the country to gain the respect accorded male athletes.These women upon whom so much pressure rested included a runway model (who also happened to be one of the few women players able to dunk), a forward who barely survived a car accident that left her in coma, a collegiate sensation struggling to live up to her rep and her huge marketing contract from Reebok, a superstar known as ""the female Michael Jordan,"" and a controversial, unrelenting coach. Nine of the women were black; three were white. Some were married, some single; some outspoken, some painfully shy. Some were rivals, some fast friends. How they came together, both on and off the court, is the subject of this wonderful celebration of the female athlete.From the Trade Paperback edition.",0.0,$9.99,Basketball,"Jun 02, 1997",422531378,Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group,English,Venus to the Hoop,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/venus-to-the-hoop/id422531378?mt=11,,Sara Corbett,"Random House, LLC",352 Pages,A Gold Medal Year in Women's Basketball
"The late 1960s and early 1970s, in New York City and America at large, were years marked by political tumult, social unrest—and the best professional basketball ever played. Paradise, for better or worse, was a hardwood court in Midtown Manhattan.When the Garden Was Eden is the definitive account of how the New York Knickerbockers won their first and only championships, and in the process provided the nation no small escape from the Vietnam War, the tragedy at Kent State, and the last vestiges of Jim Crow. The Knicks were more than a team; they were a symbol of harmony, the sublimation of individual personalities for the greater collective good.No one is better suited to revive the old chants of “Dee-fense!” that rocked Madison Square Garden or the joy that radiated courtside than Harvey Araton, who has followed the Knicks, old and new, for decades—first as a teenage fan, then as a young sports reporter with the New York Post, and now as a writer and columnist for the New York Times. Araton has traveled to the Louisiana home of the Captain, Willis Reed (after writing a column years earlier that led to his abrupt firing as the Knicks’ short-lived coach); he has strolled the lush gardens of Walt “Clyde” Frazier’s St. Croix oasis; discussed the politics of that turbulent era with Senator Bill Bradley; toured Baltimore’s church basement basketball leagues with Black Jesus himself, Earl “the Pearl” Monroe; played memory games with Jerry “the Brain” Lucas; explored the Tao of basketball with Phil “Action” Jackson; and sat through eulogies for Dave DeBusschere, the lunch-bucket, 23-year-old player-coach lured from Detroit, and Red Holzman, the scrappy Jewish guard who became a coaching legend.In When the Garden Was Eden, Araton not only traces the history of New York’s beloved franchise—from Ned Irish to Spike Lee to Carmelo Anthony—but profiles the lives and careers of one of sports’ all-time great teams, the Old Knicks. With measured prose and shoe-leather reporting, Araton relives their most glorious triumphs and bitter rivalries, and casts light on a time all but forgotten outside of pregame highlight reels and nostalgic reunions—a time when the Garden, Madison Square, was its own sort of Eden.",3.5,$11.99,Basketball,"Oct 18, 2011",454179562,Harper,English,When the Garden Was Eden,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/when-the-garden-was-eden/id454179562?mt=11,3.57895,Harvey Araton,HarperCollins,384 Pages,"Clyde, the Captain, Dollar Bill, and the Glory Days of the New York Knicks"

Oversize, with sidebars and appendices, including team statistics and records./ One Fantastic Ride is a behind-the-scenes portrait of the unforgettable journey to the University of North Carolina's 2009 basketball national championship, the program's fifth NCAA Tournament title. Adam Lucas, Steve Kirschner, and Matt Bowers were with the Tar Heels every step of the way, interviewing coaches, players, and staff. As the 2008-09 season opened, national pundits widely considered the Tar Heels the hands-down favorite to win the title. But injuries to key players, surprising midseason losses, and formidable ACC competition made the ride bumpier than expected. In the crucial last month of the season, however, a veteran team drew on their experience--and subtle adjustments by coaches and players--to achieve the goal they'd set for themselves after their disappointing defeat in the 2008 Final Four.

"From the fall of 2007 through the spring of 2008, Boston sports fans enjoyed a run of good fortune that was unprecedented in sports history. The Red Sox won their second World Series championship in four years. The Celtics, with their newly assembled big three of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen, won their first NBA championship since 1986. And the Patriots, already hailed as the first sports dynasty of the twenty-first century, roared through an undefeated regular season before being derailed by the New York Giants in a shocking upset in Super Bowl XLII.In Wicked Good Year, acclaimed Boston Herald sports columnist Steve Buckley tells the remarkable story of the dizzying, glorious seven months and twenty days when these three teams established Boston as the capital of the sports world. More than just a recitation of dates and games and stats, this book looks at that remarkable season through the eyes of the players, coaches, and team personnel, and explores how their lives created a fascinating backdrop to the action taking place on the field and the court.It was a season when old-time motivational techniques were reintroduced with Celtics coach Doc Rivers taking his big three on a tour of the parade route that had been traveled by the Red Sox and Patriots—just to show them what it's like to win a championship in Boston. It was a season when veteran Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi, no longer happy just to be playing again after recovering from a stroke, wanted to take his game to a higher level. And it was a season when a rookie second baseman named Dustin Pedroia, seen as brash and confident from afar, actually suffered through sleepless nights as he tried to find his way in his first full season with the Red Sox.Wicked Good Year also introduces an eclectic cast of devoted fans, ranging from sidewalk Red Sox autograph collector Andrew J. Urban II to internationally known singer/actor—and Celtics fanatic—Donnie Wahlberg. Buckley's tribute is a must-read not only for the Boston faithful but also for the legions of sports fans wondering exactly how these teams worked together to shed the city's ""Loserville"" image that had been in place at the dawn of the new century.

"Chris Bosh was the 4th pick of the 2003 draft, sandwiched between LeBron, Melo, and D-Wade. For some reason, though, Bosh doesn't seem to be held in the same high “Superstar” regard as his contemporaries. Just like those guys, CB has been a perennial All-Star, received max contracts, and won a gold medal. He has career averages of 19 and 8, this after reduced stats during his 4-year “Big Three” run with the Miami Heat. His numbers are poised to return to Toronto heights now, with the centerpiece role in his lap going forward in Miami. 
Chris Bosh has been ranked among the top 5 midrange shooters in the NBA, by efficiency, for several years. So when people call him a “Jump Shooter,” they're right — and if you can make them as well as Chris Bosh, you should be shooting them. 
Though CB has been talked down on by his many critics for his diminished numbers, you're reading this because game recognizes game — Chris Bosh is one of the top 25 basketball players in the world, still. This Signature Workout Program will focus on some of Chris’ best skills, including
	•	Midrange Shooting Off The Catch
	•	Driving With 1 Or 2 Dribbles From The Perimeter On Closing-Out Defenders
	•	Facing Up And Scoring In The Low And Mid-Post
	•	[BONUS] Agile, Deft Post Scoring Moves
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over

A world where NBA All Stars matchup against Footlocker Employees, where FIBA World Champions face High School Wannabes and where the salary of one team’s twelfth man equals that of this team’s entire roster. Faced with a physically torturous and spirit crushing season like no other, fifteen men battle the opposition, each other and themselves to succeed simultaneously against everyone from the Sport’s Bottom Feeders and those who feast at its Highest Table. Eighty one games over a mere eight months in fourteen countries for just one team; this team.The spotlight of Professional Basketball shines brightest on the chosen few, however once in a lifetime a select few from the humble majority get their twenty four seconds of fame. Semi-Pro-Am follows the reality of fifteen such men forever connected by their shared experience of reaching competitive heights beyond their wildest dreams while simultaneously battling though the juxtaposition of Basketball Backwaters.When offered a chance, the Manager of London’s biggest Basketball Club laid everything on the line to compete at a level no British team had ever before reached. Craving to sit at the top table with Europe’s most established Clubs as a part of the fledgling Continental Basketball scene, his story is one that will ring true for any underdog that has ever given their all and struggled to be unleashed.Charged with guiding his team through a torturous eighty game season, The Coach fought an ongoing battle to reach the summit of his Profession. Challenged daily by his Players, the Management and his own temperament, he was forced to handle the pressures of coaching three seasons in one. His plight and struggle to endure will be familiar to anyone who has ever or wants to succeed in this most stimulating of Professions.Recruited from all walks of life, twelve Players willed their overmatched bodies to compete with the very best in Europe while simultaneously searching for the motivation to retain their domestic title in Basketball’s Basement. Through a sometimes unwinnable schedule often compromising of nine games in five different countries over fifteen nights, their ambition to overcome will motivate everyone who has ever felt the fire of competitive spirit.Continually overstretched to breaking point and pushing the limits of a collective will, Semi-Pro-Am provides a firsthand insight into the intricate relationships that exists between all levels from Semi Professional to Amateur and the full time Professionals caught in between. A firsthand account of how an ever changing set of incredible circumstances set off a chain reaction with ramifications effecting everyone closest to them. Filled with a heartbreaking realism, at times almost fictional coincidence and the cruel humor that became everyday occurrences when people spend more time with their teammates than their families. Seasoned Veteran Professional Players, Unpaid Interns, Part Time Postmen, Wealthy Businessmen, Amateur High School Drop Outs, Next Generation Coaches and Semi Professional Athletes all play their part.Semi-Pro-Am continually shifts the spotlight from Center Court to the shadows of Professional Basketball and back again. Connecting Flights to Tour Buses, Locker Rooms to Hotel Rooms, Health Clubs to Night Clubs and Barcelona to Brighton; the reader follows in the footsteps of this once in a lifetime team that became like no other. For the first time, revealing true stories played out by those closest to the game you love; unwrapping secrets that you thought existed but could never before see. Over twelve years in the making, Semi-Pro-Am is an essential addition to the bookshelf of anyone who has a passion for Basketball and a hunger to learn more about the reality of Professional Sport from one of the few people that witnessed it all first-hand.",0.0,$3.99,Basketball,"Jan 31, 2014",785671228,GR Wilson,English,SEMI-PRO-AM: The Basketball Reality You Never Knew,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/semi-pro-am-basketball-reality/id785671228?mt=11,,GR Wilson,Smashwords,348 Pages,

"Handling the ball (next to making a layup) is the most basic of basketball skills. Dribbling the ball from Point A to Point B is a skill necessary to any player, regardless of size or position. If you can't dribble the ball effectively to get from location to location, you are a liability to your team. Lacking any basic, fundamental skill (such as dribbling) makes you, by definition, a below-average player.
	So let's build your handle. Following this program and the drills within are guaranteed to make you a significantly better dribbler within a week.

"""A reporting tour de force and an utterly gripping account… Outside Shot unmistakably triumphs, with the reader rooting hard for the Cardinals--and delighted that O'Brien has brought his considerable skills to telling their story.""  --Wayne Coffey, New York Times Book ReviewThe Cardinals of Scott County High School were beloved once---and with good reason. For years, the boys and their legendary coach gave fans in central Kentucky, deep in the heart of basketball country, just what they wanted: state titles, national rankings, and countless trips to Kentucky's one-of-a-kind state tournament, where winning and losing can change a young man's life. But in 2009, with the economy sputtering, anger rising, and Scott County mired in a two-year drought, fans had begun to lose faith in the boys. They weren't the heroes of Scott County anymore; they were ""mini-athlete gods,"" haunted by dreams, burdened by expectations, and desperate to escape through the only means they knew: basketball. In Outside Shot, Keith O'Brien takes us on an epic journey, from the bluegrass hills and broken homes of rural America, to inner-city Lexington, to Kentucky's most hallowed hall: Rupp Arena, where high school tournament games are known to draw twenty-thousand people, and where, for the players and their fans, it feels like anything is possible. The narrative follows four of the team's top seniors and their coach as they struggle to redeem themselves in the face of impossible odds: once-loyal fans now turned against them, parents who demand athletic greatness, and scouts who weigh their every move. It delves deep inside the lives of the boys, their families, and their community---divided along lines of race, politics, religion, and sports. And it chronicles not only the high-stakes world of Kentucky basketball, but the battle for the soul of small-town America. A story of inspiration and poignancy, filled with moments of drama on and off the court, Outside Shot shows that if it's hard to win basketball games, it can be even harder to win at life itself.",4.0,$9.99,Basketball,"Jan 15, 2013",e-shot/id550170234,St. Martin's Press,English,Outside Shot,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/outside-shot/id550170234?mt=11,4.0,Keith O’Brien,"Macmillan / Holtzbrinck Publishers, LLC",250 Pages,"Big Dreams, Hard Times, and One County's Quest for Basketball Greatness"
"Kenny Sailors was a basketball star, and the inventor of the jump shot. He attended the University of Wyoming and was MVP in 1943 in college AA basketball. After WWII, he spent five years as an early player in the new NBA. As a youngster, Kenny was five‑foot‑seven but his older brother was six‑foot‑two so when playing basketball, Kenny had to jump up over his brother to get off a shot. That is how the jump shot was born, and 
 Kenny used it in college and professional basketball. He played in Denver and several other cities whose team names have now changed, but he also played for the Boston Celtics with Bob Cousy. After he left the NBA, he moved to Alaska and in 1965 settled in the Glennallen area, where he was a fishing and hunting guide in the Wrangle Mountains for thirty‑five years.

"On the night of March 2, 1962, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, right up the street from the chocolate factory, Wilt Chamberlain, a young and striking athlete celebrated as the Big Dipper, scored one hundred points in a game against the New York Knickerbockers.As historic and revolutionary as the achievement was, it remains shrouded in myth. The game was not televised; no New York sportswriters showed up; and a fourteen-year-old local boy ran onto the court when Chamberlain scored his hundredth point, shook his hand, and then ran off with the basketball. In telling the story of this remarkable night, author Gary M. Pomerantz brings to life a lost world of American sports.In 1962, the National Basketball Association, stepchild to the college game, was searching for its identity. Its teams were mostly white, the number of black players limited by an unspoken quota. Games were played in drafty, half-filled arenas, and the players traveled on buses and trains, telling tall tales, playing cards, and sometimes reading Joyce. Into this scene stepped the unprecedented Wilt Chamberlain: strong and quick-witted, voluble and enigmatic, a seven-footer who played with a colossal will and a dancer’s grace. That strength, will, grace, and mystery were never more in focus than on March 2, 1962. Pomerantz tracked down Knicks and Philadelphia Warriors, fans, journalists, team officials, other NBA stars of the era, and basketball historians, conducting more than 250 interviews in all, to recreate in painstaking detail the game that announced the Dipper’s greatness. He brings us to Hershey, Pennsylvania, a sweet-seeming model of the gentle, homogeneous small-town America that was fast becoming anachronistic. We see the fans and players, alternately fascinated and confused by Wilt, drawn anxiously into the spectacle. Pomerantz portrays the other legendary figures in this story: the Warriors’ elegant coach Frank McGuire; the beloved, if rumpled, team owner Eddie Gottlieb; and the irreverent p.a. announcer Dave “the Zink” Zinkoff, who handed out free salamis courtside.At the heart of the book is the self-made Chamberlain, a romantic cosmopolitan who owned a nightclub in Harlem and shrugged off segregation with a bebop cool but harbored every slight deep in his psyche. March 2, 1962, presented the awesome sight of Wilt Chamberlain imposing himself on a world that would diminish him. Wilt, 1962 is not only the dramatic story of a singular basketball game but a meditation on small towns, midcentury America, and one of the most intriguing figures in the pantheon of sports heroes.

"The triple threat position -- the situation in which you have the ball and have yet to initiate your dribble, and are a threat from your current position to either dribble, pass or shoot -- is the most powerful position for an offensive basketball player. A defender has to defend against all three threats (that is, if you are capable of attacking all three ways) and has no idea what you are going to do. Essentially, she is at your mercy. 
Are you prepared, skill-wise, to take advantage? This Hoop Handbook will have you on your way, with it’s focus on the jab step and options using the jab step. 
A jab step is a step you take with the foot that is not your pivot foot to probe and attack the defense. A jab step can be slow or quick, short or long, to the left, right, forward or backward. Its purpose is to put pressure on the defense, and to see how a defender reacts to it -- and then to take advantage of what you see and feel. This Handbook is not to tell you which moves to use and when -- that’s not how you play high-level basketball. You must develop the skills to respond to what you see in the moment, which you cannot predict. With enough skill, you will have a move or technique to react to anything and everything a defense/ defender tries. 
We cover passing in the Passing Mini-Handbook and shooting in the Shooting and the Scoring Moves #2 Handbooks. This Handbook will focus on attacking off the dribble for drives and jumpshots with the jab step. Once you become familiar with the movements, you will find that you can get creative and come up with your own combinations of moves and footwork -- the driving moves can be used to create jumpshots, the shooting moves can be used for driving, etc. ",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644692167,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #13- Triple Threat / Jab Step,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-13-triple-threat/id644692167?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,13 Pages,Creating Space & Scoring Opportunities Using Your Footwork from the Tiple Treat Position

"The New York Times bestselling author of Sweetness delivers the first all-encompassing account of the 1980s Los Angeles Lakers, one of professional sports’ most-revered—and dominant—dynasties.	The Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s personified the flamboyance and excess of the decade over which they reigned. Beginning with the arrival of Earvin “Magic” Johnson as the number-one overall pick of the 1979 draft, the Lakers played basketball with gusto and pizzazz, unleashing their famed “Showtime” run-and-gun style on a league unprepared for their speed and ferocity—and became the most captivating show in sports and, arguably, in all-around American entertainment. The Lakers’ roster overflowed with exciting all-star-caliber players, including center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and they were led by the incomparable Pat Riley, known for his slicked-back hair, his Armani suits, and his arrogant strut. Hollywood’s biggest celebrities lined the court and gorgeous women flocked to the arena. Best of all, the team was a winner. Between 1980 and 1991, the Lakers played in an unmatched nine NBA championship series, capturing five of them.	Bestselling sportswriter Jeff Pearlman draws from almost three hundred interviews to take the first full measure of the Lakers’ epic Showtime era. A dazzling account of one of America’s greatest sports sagas, Showtime is packed with indelible characters, vicious rivalries, and jaw-dropping, behind-the-scenes stories of the players’ decadent Hollywood lifestyles.  From the Showtime era’s remarkable rise to its tragic end—marked by Magic Johnson’s 1991 announcement that he had contracted HIV—Showtime is a gripping narrative of sports, celebrity, and 1980s-style excess.",4.5,$9.99,Basketball,"Mar 04, 2014",663462417,Penguin Publishing Group,English,Showtime,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/showtime/id663462417?mt=11,4.66071,Jeff Pearlman,Penguin Group (USA) Inc.,496 Pages,"Magic, Kareem, Riley, and the Los Angeles Lakers Dynasty ofthe 1980s"
"An irreverent, hilarious insider's look at big-time NCAA basketball, through the eyes of the nation's most famous benchwarmer and author of the popular blog ClubTrillion.com (3.6m visits!).

"On a March afternoon in Cleveland, St. Bonaventure battled powerful Kentucky for 40 minutes and two overtimes in the first round of the 2000 NCAA Tournament. Though the Bonnies would lose that day, the moments that accompanied that game provided St. Bonaventure's proud alumni a vast sense of pride. For a men's basketball program that was once considered an elite entity, it was fulfilling return to glory.

No one could have envisioned then that St. Bonaventure basketball would endure lowest of lows almost exactly three years later.

The St. Bonaventure basketball scandal of 2003 created national headlines and rocked to its core a proud institution. The university president schemed to allow an ineligible player, by NCAA standards, on the court, leading to series of damning events. Victories were forfeited, a team in turmoil quit on its season, several of those involved were fired and the president of the board of trustees, ripped by his role in the sorry state of affairs, committed suicide. As student-managers, we closely witnessed the circumstances that led to the upheaval. We were in the locker room, the coaches offices and on the team bench.

"During the last four decades women’s and gender history have become vibrant fields including studies of attitudes regarding the limited physical and other abilities of females as well as studies of the accomplishments of notable female athletes. We have become increasingly aware that women have made contributions to physical education, dance and sport that go far beyond being teachers, athletes and coaches. They have created and implemented an astonishing variety of programs intended to serve the needs of large numbers of children and youth sometimes organizing student health services, as well as chairing departments of physical education. They have worked as directors of sport, physical education and dance, running playgrounds and recreational facilities and have created and/or served as important officers of a variety of sporting organizations. 
This book explores the contributions and achievements of women in a variety of historical and geographical contexts which, not surprisingly opens opportunities for additions, revisions and counter-narratives to accepted histories of physical education and sport science. It seeks to broaden our understandings about the backgrounds, motivations and achievements of dedicated women working to improve health and bodily practices in a variety of different arenas and for often different purposes.This book was previously published as a special issue of the International Journal of the History of Sport.",0.0,$54.99,Social Science,"Sep 13, 2013",708258614,Taylor and Francis,English,"Women, Sport, Society",https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/women-sport-society/id708258614?mt=11,,Roberta J Park & Patricia Vertinsky,Taylor & Francis Group,224 Pages,"Further Reflections, Reaffirming Mary Wollstonecraft"

"In 2013, Basketball may or may not be the world's second most popular sport behind football (soccer) but the game's growth has exploded since the 1984 Olympics. Dr. James Naismith created the game in 1891 and while it was a popular game, the professional version of the sport did not do well. Leagues came and went. Some of the best teams in the early days didn't play in an organized league and instead barnstormed and played games wherever a promoter put down a floor and offered a few bucks to pay the players.The most successful of all the early basketball leagues, the National Basketball League, began operations in 1937. The NBL was based in the United States with teams that seemingly were aligned with the American auto industry in the Great Lakes region.In 1946, the American east coast-based arena owners began the Basketball Association of America. By 1949, the BAA owners were able to entice NBL franchises to join the new league and in 1949, the National Basketball Association was formed with the amalgamation of the two leagues.Basketball in the United States reflected the post-Civil War America. Negro players proved they could play with their white counterparts but were shut out of the professional leagues. The all-Negro clubs, the New York Rens and the Harlem Globetrotters won the World Professional Tournament in 1939 and 1940 beating established all-white National Basketball League teams. The NBL desegregated in 1942. The NBA would not sign a Negro player until 1950.The Harlem Globetrotters would be scheduled as part of an exhibition-NBA doubleheader in many NBA cities because the Globetrotters will draw a crowd. The 1950s NBA was a sports non-entity.In the 1960s, two leagues challenged the NBA for major league status in the United States. Both failed but changed the basketball industry despite financial problems.In the 1980s, the NBA was still on the brink of failure. This is the story of the professional basketball from the people who were there, their story of old cars, dance halls and chasing TV dollars.The book ends on February 1, 1984, the day David Stern became the fourth Commissioner of the National Basketball Association. Somehow the NBA survived against long odds in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Stern's NBA is sturdy. Franchise values have soared over a half billion dollars. The pioneers of basketball never did think the NBA would become a global entity.

"The inspiring story of Isaiah Austin, the man who captured our hearts when he was made the honorary NBA draft pick after a shocking diagnosis ended his professional basketball career before he could even step onto the court.“There are two choices in life: you make it your excuse or you make it your story.” Isaiah Austin’s mother shared these words of wisdom with him as a child as he came to terms with a torn retina taking away the ability to see with his right eye. Faced with adversity at such a young age, Isaiah had to choose—let his disability define him or overcome the challenge and shine.Overcoming that challenge is exactly what Isaiah did as he made a name for himself on Baylor University’s NCAA Division 1 basketball team. Everyone expected Isaiah to have a successful career in the NBA after college, but on June 21, 2014—just five days before the NBA draft—Austin was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue, putting him at risk of rupturing his heart if he continued to play basketball. In seconds, Austin’s hopes for a career in the NBA became impossible.After hearing about Isaiah’s diagnosis, NBA commissioner Adam Silver invited Austin to attend the 2014 draft as his personal guest. The League recognized Isaiah’s courage, resilience, and determination in a bittersweet moment when he was made an Honorary Draft Pick.Rather than letting another challenge destroy his faith, Austin has once again strived to overcome adversity by becoming a spokesperson for The Marfan Foundation, raising awareness and understanding for the disease. Despite the many heartbreaking challenges he has faced, Isaiah’s story is inspirational and full of hope as he encourages everyone to tower in the face of adversity and keep living out your dreams, no matter what life throws your way.*Proceeds from Dream Again will go to the Isaiah Austin Foundation, which provides support for the awareness and research of Marfan syndrome and those affected by it.",4.5,$12.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Jun 23, 2015",936215346,Howard Books,English,Dream Again,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/dream-again/id936215346?mt=11,4.5,Isaiah Austin,Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc.,224 Pages,"A Story of Faith, Courage, and the Tenacity to Overcome"

Technical skills (such as dribbling, shooting, and rebounding) are examined in depth, as are the tactical skills (such as the give-and-go, backdoor cut, and trapping). More than 195 photos and illustrations bring the basic to intermediate skills to life, while sample season and practice plans will help you in your preparation.

"We covered the technique of the crossover dribble in the Crossover Hoop Handbook. This program addresses the skills of actually scoring and doing moves in games with the crossover dribble. 
A crossover can be wide or tight, and performed at varying speeds -- the purpose of the move is to create space for yourself; what is necessary to create space is always changing depending on the circumstances of the game(s). Whatever works to make that happen, is a good use of the move at that moment. 
Any coach, however, will tell you that a move is worthless if it doesn't result in a made basket or at least a foul -- moves alone are not worth points. So a nice crossover move alone isn’t enough -- you gotta finish the job. This Handbook will show you how. That being said, all drills done in this program count reps by made baskets, not attempts. 
The moves in the demonstration videos are done form certain areas of the floor, but you are not married to these areas. When you are working through the program, work in the areas that fit your game and the situations you (expect to) see. Experiment with varying finishing techniques -- floater, runners, layups, dunks (if you can).",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644705983,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #18 - Crossover Scoring Moves,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-18-crossover/id644705983?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,14 Pages,Creating & Scoring Using Your Crossover Dribble

"""A wonderful book—not just for basketball fans but for everyone.""—Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson
A good reporter can pick up a pen and chronicle the game of basketball, from its X’s and O’s to its personalities.
A great reporter can put down the pen and pick up the rock.
Ira Berkow has been many things in his life—a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, a respected columnist, and a passionate sports fan.  He also knows how to thread a pass into the paint.  In this wildly entertaining chronicle of his life as both a devotee and gym rat, Berkow writes with good humor and piercing insight about talking strategy with Walt Frazier, running the court with Oscar Robertson, and seeing the game from the inside.  From his youth, playing on the courts in Chicago in the ‘40’s and ‘50’s to growing older and using the wisdom he’s gained to school players half his age, Berkow retains a competitive spirit, and a deep love of hoops.  This moving tale of love for the game, for his friends and family, and for life itself is a must-read for anyone who wants the ball when the game is on the line.
""An extraordinary look into the art of pickup basketball. Who would have guessed that, along with his writing talents, Ira knows how to play the game!""—Bill Bradley

"From the authors of the national bestseller Leafs AbomiNation, the story behind the success of one of Canada's greatest athletes, NBA all-star Steve Nash. A small man in a big man's game, a white man in a game dominated by black men, a rare Canadian in a US-based industry, the unlikely rise of Steve Nash, from Victoria high school to Hollywood hardwood, is compelling proof that great things await those who refuse to accept less of themselves. Nearly 2 decades into a Hall of Fame-bound career, Nash is a 2-time MVP, an 8-time all-star and wearer of one of the league's top-selling jerseys. And no one but Nash saw it coming.With the combination of wit and comprehensive reporting that distinguished Leafs AbomiNation, Feschuk and Grange tell the extraordinary story of drive, confidence, commitment and learning to do without that post-game beer that turned a Canadian's improbable NBA dream into the stuff of sporting legend. They convincingly bust a host of oft-repeated myths. That Nash is an inferior athlete is one: he might be one of the best athletes in the world, when factors like coordination, vision, balance and work ethic are given weight alongside size, speed and power. The myth that he overcame his upbringing in Canada to make it in the NBA is another: Growing up in Victoria, B.C., in the mid-1980s was more likely why he turned into the player he did.Revealing, playful and a perfect read for any sports fan, Steve Nash is the inspiring story of the consummate athletic outlier.",0.0,$14.99,Basketball,"Oct 29, 2013",422516369,Random House of Canada,English,Steve Nash,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/steve-nash/id422516369?mt=11,,Dave Feschuk & Michael Grange,"Random House, LLC",224 Pages,The Unlikely Ascent of a Superstar

"As discussed in the Shooting Hoop Handbook, If you can make outside shots, that skill will last longer than your ability to explode on the rim or blow by defenders. And once you have established your ability to make outside shots, defense will adjust: crowding your space, running you off of your sweet shooting spots, attempting to disrupt your rhythm.
This Handbook is the good shooter’s answer to those defensive tactics. Never allow the defense or defender to dictate your actions -- you take whatever they do (crowding your space, for example), and use it against them (using quick first-step and jab-step moves, again, for example). 
The drills and moves you learn here are all designed to free you to get your outside shot off -- no matter what the defense does. Once you put the ball on the floor, force the defender to react to you -- all you need is solid ball handling skills (which you got from the Ball Handling Handbook). 
Once you go through the Handbook and get familiar with the moves and drills while also gaining confidence in your abilities, be creative -- both with the setup of the workouts and with the actual moves. Your game is your game, no one else’s.

"From Kansas City Star Books ... here's the season-long story of the remarkable, resilient University of Kansas Jayhawks. The Jayhawks finished their season on April 2, 2012, with a loss to the Kentucky Wildcats in the championship game of the NCAA Tournament. But a season cannot be measured strictly by the last loss. The measure of a team is in its heart, its attitude and resiliency. By those measures, this team ended its season as winners. This book, Comeback Kids, recaps a remarkable season that began with doubts and question marks and ended on college basketball's biggest stage. This was a team that took on the nation's best opponents and beat most of them. This was a team that discovered its own weaknesses and overcame them. This team never said die.

"A reliable outside shot will last you longer than the ability to fly through the lane and dunk. And there are lots of great players (Steve Nash, Isiah Thomas come to mind) who dominate games with, among other skills, great Ball Handling (See the Ball Handling Handbook) and shooting ability. Players who can “only shoot” always stick around longer than players who can “only jump,” right? Think about it. 
The most important factor in your shooting is consistency: Shooting the same way (whatever way that may be) every time and practicing it enough that your shots go in the basket at a high rate. 
We all face an issue when working out alone and shooting - chasing down rebounds and made shots. Well, Michael Jordan chased his rebounds. Kobe too. And I do also. So if you want to be a good shooter, you can, and will, do the same. If you have a rebounder, that’s great too. Taking into account that many of you work out alone, each day’s drills will not exceed 200 made shots (not counting free throws, or extra shots for the ladder drills). What matters is what you can do on a consistent basis -- so making 500 shots on Monday, and only 50 the other 6 days of the week, is not more productive than making 150 on each of 7 days.

"In the ranks of NCAA college basketball, Duke University is like something scraped off the bottom of a shoe. It's like a nasty virus you catch from a door handle at a public toilet.No team in sports is as uniquely hated as those smug, entitled, floor-slapping, fist-pumping, insufferable Blue Devils.

"As the last seconds ticked down at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, the most bizarre, tumultuous and cursed season in the 23-year history of the Orlando Magic mercifully came to an end. Coach Stan Van Gundy, known to keep coaching until the final buzzer, walked to the opposing bench with 10 seconds left in the lopsided playoff elimination game to congratulate young Frank Vogel, coach of the Indiana Pacers. Even more conspicuous than this rare mid-game conciliatory gesture from Van Gundy was the absence of the team's most recognizable, talented superstar: Dwight Howard. Howard had always talked about winning a championship and bringing joy to Orlando. Despite this, the face of the franchise did not show his face throughout the playoffs, opting to undergo three weeks' worth of rehabilitation in the Los Angeles area following his season-ending back injury. This sour finale was an ignominious ending matched only by this ill-fated season's tumultuous beginning. Entering training camp after a prolonged off-season, Howard stunned the team and town by delivering a defiant trade request to Magic management. Even more devastating for Magic fans was that this request to be dealt to another team was vividly reminiscent of a similar event from a decade ago, when the Magic's last franchise star center, Shaquille O'Neal, abandoned Florida for the Los Angeles Lakers. Howard and the Magic for so long seemed like the perfect match, and had even grown up together in many ways. The 2004 NBA draft brought together a skinny, devoutly religious teenage sensation and a squeaky-clean, family-run ownership down on its luck. Howard blossomed into a global superstar, turning the Magic into contenders. The city of Orlando embraced its new happy-go-lucky hero and fell in love with its basketball team again. They were once inseparable, as close as a player and a franchise could possibly be in today’s NBA. What followed was one of the most bizarre reality shows to befall any professional sports team in memory, with Howard taking the Magic on a wild, emotional and confounding ride. There was presidential-like flip-flopping, a near trade, an 11th-hour reprieve, farcical front-office fumbling, YouTube moments, a drunk-dialing accusation, media shenanigans and one heart-attack scare, among other things. And the soap opera is far from over. Follow the Orlando Sentinel's unmatched coverage of this ongoing saga with Dwightmare: Dwight Howard, the Orlando Magic, and the Season of Dysfunction. From the very beginning of Howard's career through the ouster of coach Stan Van Gundy and general manager Otis Smith, this book is the only place where the entirety of this saga's sordid details have been collected, analyzed, and boiled down to their bare facts.

"A strong, serious basketball player does not possess a “weak hand.” The only thing a dedicated player wonʼt be able to do with her non-dominant hand is shoot jumpshots. Finishing and dribbling -- the two main focuses of this program -- should be interchangeable between your two hands.
 
A layup is the easiest way to score in basketball; it only makes sense to be able to convert this easy shot with either hand from all angles around the basket. You also need to be able to navigate your way to the basket area with your ball handling. This program is designed to have you doing just that.
 
While going through this program, it is very important to remember that the moves and drills you go through in practicing are not, necessarily, the moves youʼll do in the games. Understand what a drill is: a skill executed repeatedly, to be ingrained into your muscle memory. The purpose of doing basketball drills is so your body memorizes the movement, which then can be called upon instinctively and unconsciously when needed. You are not consciously memorizing these moves for doing versus a defender. In a live game, things happen too fast for any human being to think of how to react -- by the time the thought comes to you, the moment to do what you thought of has passed. And with the endless possibilities and situations in the game of basketball, memorizing moves is not a viable strategy; every single play is a unique situation. What you want to be able to do in games is to react without thinking: whatever happens, you react instinctively and decisively. This ability is developed through two combined methods: skill practice and game experience. You have taken a proactive step in the skill practice area by getting this program; go to work. Then go use these skills in games to fine-tune your reactive, instinctive abilities.",0.0,$2.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644753660,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #31- Left / Weak Hand #2,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-31-left-weak/id644753660?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,12 Pages,All The Skills You Need for Your Non-Dominant Hand

"Dwight Howard: You either love his game (and personality) or you hate it. One of the most devastating defensive players in the game and a vacuum for rebounds, Dwight stepped up his offensive game to 20+ points per game for 4 out of his last 5 season in Orlando and before he had to give up some shot attempts while playing with top-flight scorers for the first time in his career for the past two seasons. 
After working with Hall Of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon one offseason on his footwork and deftness and touch in the post, Dwight has unveiled a whole new bag of tricks for getting his shots in the post. Dwight gets whatever shot he wants to get when he calls for the ball in the post, and has found ways to maintain his efficiency while sharing the shots that go around. 
This Signature Workout Program focuses on Dwight’s Best offensive skills, namely:
• Explosive One-Dribble Post Moves 
• Spin Moves Off Of Leaning Defenders
• Running Hooks And Baby Hook Shots When Facing Up In Post! • Post Face-Up Shooting
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over

"Once you show that you can make outside shots, defense will close in, crowding your space and daring you to put the ball on floor. Itʼs time you take them up on their offer and kill them anyway.
 
Sound good to you? Then this is your program.
 
 
Moves for Shooters will take you through drills and skills for developing your ability to create open jumpshots for yourself with both your footwork, body positioning and ball handling. You will no longer be just a spot-up shooter relegated to stand in one spot on offense; you are now a dynamic scorer who is hard to guard and has to be strategized against.
 
While going through this program, it is very important to remember that the moves and drills you go through in practicing are not, necessarily, the moves youʼll do in the games. Understand what a drill is: a skill executed repeatedly, to be ingrained into your muscle memory. The purpose of doing basketball drills is so your body memorizes the movement, which then can be called upon instinctively and unconsciously when needed. You are not consciously memorizing these moves for doing versus a defender. In a live game, things happen too fast for any human being to think of how to react -- by the time the thought comes to you, the moment to do what you thought of has passed. And with the endless possibilities and situations in the game of basketball, memorizing moves is not a viable strategy; every single play is a unique situation. What you want to be able to do in games is to react without thinking: whatever happens, you react instinctively and decisively.

"Two-time All-Star and thirteen-year NBA veteran Caron Butler has an impressive basketball record. He was Big East Co-Player of the Year at UConn, the 10th overall pick of the 2002 NBA Draft and a key player for the Dallas Mavericks in their championship-winning season in 2011.But before Butler had a chance to prove himself on the court, he spent his time trying to prove himself on the streets, as a gang member and drug dealer in his hometown of Racine, Wisconsin. He saw friends gunned down in the bloody street wars near his home, was arrested nearly 15 times and wound up behind bars and in solitary confinement before his 15th birthday. Tuff Juice shares Caron Butler’s extraordinary journey from his delinquent youth in the streets of Racine to his role as an accomplished pro basketball player, dedicated husband and father, active philanthropist and burgeoning businessman. Along the way, the book explores the incredible impact his single mother’s unconditional love and his college coach’s unwavering support had on him, and what drives him to be so successful in basketball and in life. Like The Blind Side, it’s a gripping narrative filled with hubris, dangerous obstacles and heartwarming moments that transcend sports and speak to perseverance, hope and the triumph of the human spirit.",0.0,$24.99,Basketball,"Sep 24, 2015",1042553876,Lyons Press,English,Tuff Juice,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/tuff-juice/id1042553876?mt=11,,Caron Butler & Steve Springer,The Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group,272 Pages,My Journey from the Streets to the NBA

"The jumpstop/pro-hop move does what your allowed “two steps” does -- allow you to cover ground without actually bouncing the ball, but in a different way. You can use a leap or jump to slice through defenders and land strongly on two feet, and, unlike with your two steps, you still have the option of stoping completely and shot faking or passing after the jumpstop is completed.
 
 
 
 
(There have been times when our favorite players have been allowed to jumpstop and follow that with a pivoting move. I was taught that this technique was a travel and not allowed. Thus, this program will not feature any drills in which this technique is used.)
 
The jumpstop allows you to remain under full control of your body, absorb more contact (your center of gravity is stronger with both feet on the ground than with only one foot down), and affords you a couple of options -- described in the first paragraph -- that other ways of driving do not. This program will take you through an array of scoring moves and techniques, all using the jumpstop.

"When Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey decided to break the “color line” and integrate major league baseball in the 1940s, he spent years doing exhaustive background research and interviewing players. This role could not just go to an extraordinary athlete, but one of immense character as well
Things went down with integration in the National Basketball Association a bit differently. The NBA had only formed in 1946, and was still sorting out franchises and struggling for recognition on April 25, 1950 when the basketball owners sat down for the annual player draft. When the second round began, Boston Celtics owner Walter Brown selected an African-American All-American guard out of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh named Chuck Cooper.
A few weeks after the draft, the New York Knickerbockers made a deal to purchase the contract of Nathaniel “Sweetwater” Clifton from the Harlem Globetrotters; he became the second African-American to sign an NBA contract on May 24. So, the 1950-51 National Basketball Association season tipped off with three African-Americans on active rosters. 
While Robinson became one of America's greatest heroes, the stories of the black pioneers who broke down the NBA color barrier went untold. Jackie Robinson was recognized by his sport by being elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame the first year he was eligible to appear on the ballot in 1962. Not so for Clifton. He was not inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame until the Class of 2014, more than 50 years after he converted his last NBA hook shot and a quarter century after his death.

"In 1972, the University of Arizona built McKale Center, a basketball arena that seated nearly 14,000 people. Filling that arena would present considerable challenges: the Wildcats hadn't been to an NCAA post-season tournament for over two decades, and attendance at Bear Down Gymnasium, which holds 3,000, was dismal. Enter Fred Snowden. Tasked with developing a basketball program that would justify the existence of the arena, the newly appointed head coach exceeded all expectations. He assembled a staff of high-quality assistant coaches, recruited dynamic, talented players who made the games exciting to watch, and -- perhaps most importantly -- got the Tucson community to support those players. He accomplished all of this while receiving hate mail and death threats from people who didn't approve of the Wildcats being led to victory by the first black coach in NCAA division one for a major school in a major conference. Tucson a Basketball Town shines a light on an often overlooked chapter in UA history. Fans of the game will be sure to root for Coach Snowden as he transforms Tucson into the basketball town we know and love.About the AuthorRobert A.

"This program is part of the Triple Threat Scoring Moves Package. 
 
With good footwork, ball protection and attacking angles, the techniques you use out of the triple threat position can be just as potent -- if not more -- than any moves you can execute off the dribble. The jab step is both a probing move -- used to see how a defense reacts to you, how an opponentʼs feet move -- and an attacking move, designed to get a defender moving or leaning one way while you are attacking a different angle.
 
This program is completely dedicated to the jab step move and creating out of the tripe threat position (off-the-catch, you have not yet used your dribble, and you are within your scoring range), both driving and scoring from the outside. Going to your right and to your left.
 
While going through this program, it is very important to remember that the moves and drills you go through in practicing are not, necessarily, the moves youʼll do in the games. Understand what a drill is: a skill executed repeatedly, to be ingrained into your muscle memory. The purpose of doing basketball drills is so your body memorizes the movement, which then can be called upon instinctively and unconsciously when needed. You are not consciously memorizing these moves for doing versus a defender. In a live game, things happen too fast for any human being to think of how to react -- by the time the thought comes to you, the moment to do what you thought of has passed. And with the endless possibilities and situations in the game of basketball, memorizing moves is not a viable strategy; every single play is a unique situation. What you want to be able to do in games is to react without thinking: whatever happens, you react instinctively and decisively. This ability is developed through two combined methods: skill practice and game experience. You have taken a proactive step in the skill practice area by getting this program; go to work.

"""Big League City: Oklahoma City's Rise to the NBA"" is the fascinating story behind the transformative moment when major league sports arrived in Oklahoma City.
Senator David Holt’s position as the Mayor of Oklahoma City's chief of staff from 2006 through 2010 gave him a unique opportunity to observe how a series of serendipitous events, along with the stubborn commitment of his sports-minded boss and the unified effort of perceptive investors, community leaders and City staff, brought the dream of NBA basketball to Oklahoma City.
  
Holt — a state senator, lawyer and first-time author — writes with the clear narrative style of a natural storyteller. In his deft hands the story becomes a compelling narrative, fascinating reading not only for Oklahoma City Thunder fans, but also for those interested in popular culture and the impact of professional sports on a city’s rise to prominence in the 21st Century.

For 38 years, she has broken records, winning more games than any NCAA team in basketball history. She has coached an undefeated season, co-captained the first women's Olympic team, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and has been named Sports Illustrated 'Sportswoman of the Year'.She owes her coaching success to her personal struggles and triumphs. She learned to be tough from her strict, demanding father. Motherhood taught her to balance that rigidity with communication and kindness. She is a role model for the many women she's coached; 74 of her players have become coaches.Pat's life took a shocking turn in 2011, when she was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, an irreversible brain condition that affects 5 million Americans.

"As discussed in the Shooting Hoop Handbook, If you can make outside shots, that skill will last longer than your ability to explode on the rim or blow by defenders. And once you have established your ability to make outside shots, defense will adjust: crowding your space, running you off of your sweet shooting spots, attempting to disrupt your rhythm.
This Handbook is the good shooter’s answer to those defensive tactics. Never allow the defense or defender to dictate your actions -- you take whatever they do (crowding your space, for example), and use it against them (using quick first-step and jab-step moves, again, for example). 
The drills and moves you learn here are all designed to free you to get your outside shot off -- no matter what the defense does. Once you put the ball on the floor, force the defender to react to you -- all you need is solid ball handling skills (which you got from the Ball Handling Handbook). 
Once you go through the Handbook and get familiar with the moves and drills while also gaining confidence in your abilities, be creative -- both with the setup of the workouts and with the actual moves. Your game is your game, no one else’s.

"This book is, ostensibly, about a single basketball game. Officially, the Soviet Union beat the United States, 51-50, in the gold medal game at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich on a desperate basket at the final buzzer.In many ways, the game was for the Soviets a mirror image of what the U.S. Olympic hockey team would experience eight years later at the Winter Games in Lake Placid: an improbable, almost unthinkable, victory over the sport's long-time Olympic standard-bearers and a Cold War shot in the arm for a politically struggling government.But that is where the similarities end. Because there's one Olympian-sized difference between what is, arguably, each country's greatest Olympic achievement: the Soviets didn't actually win the gold medal in basketball in 1972. Or, more specifically, they have never been recognized as having won by their American opponents.

Good. Thatʼs what youʼre doing with this program.
 
No area of scoring is spared in this program:
• Simple scoring attack moves
• Combination moves
• Off-dribble scoring
• Scoring off-the-catch
• Footwork techniques
• Ball handling for scoring

While going through this program, it is very important to remember that the moves and drills you go through in practicing are not, necessarily, the moves youʼll do in the games. Understand what a drill is: a skill executed repeatedly, to be ingrained into your muscle memory. The purpose of doing basketball drills is so your body memorizes the movement, which then can be called upon instinctively and unconsciously when needed. You are not consciously memorizing these moves for doing versus a defender. In a live game, things happen too fast for any human being to think of how to react -- by the time the thought comes to you, the moment to do what you thought of has passed. And with the endless possibilities and situations in the game of basketball, memorizing moves is not a viable strategy; every single play is a unique situation. What you want to be able to do in games is to react without thinking: whatever happens, you react instinctively and decisively. This ability is developed through two combined methods: skill practice and game experience. You have taken a proactive step in the skill practice area by getting this program; go to work.

"As part of the acclaimed Sports Virtues series, Bill Bradley: Intelligence discusses the struggles and triumphs of Bill Bradley’s life. As with each story in the Sports Virtues series, this book assigns a virtue to a celebrated athlete or coach, and uses that person's story to help the reader achieve that virtue for him or herself.
What emerges after reading these stories is not only a greater understanding and appreciation of the virtues that these icons needed to get through life, but also an inspiration for the reader. Each story is followed by a small quotation from literature to amplify the meaning and application of the virtue, and each story is also followed by a series of study/review questions and other interactive activities to help the reader further understand the virtue and how to achieve it.
This book is for people of all ages, but it makes for the perfect gift from parents to children or from adult mentors to their students.

"A player who can get into the paint and to the basket brings significant value to their team for several reasons, a few being:

You put pressure on the defense
Creating scoring opportunities for teammates with passes after compromising the defense
Theoretically, the closer to the basket, the easier the shot
Driving to the basket creates fouls and easy points in the form of free throws

After Scoring Moves #1, #2, and #3, this Handbook is a completely new set of moves and drills. The moves and drills in Scoring Moves Handbooks #s 4, 5 and 6 are more advanced, as a whole, than the moves in Scoring Moves 1, 2 and 3. 
 
 
You should be comfortable with all the drills in the Ball Handling Handbook in order to make good use of Scoring Move Handbooks 4, 5 and 6. 
The most important points to remember when practicing your driving skills: 1) Be able to finish around the hoop with both hands, 2) The lower player will get to the spot first.
Once you go through the Handbook and get familiar with the moves and drills while also gaining confidence in your abilities, be creative -- both with the setup of the workouts and with the actual moves. Your game is your game, no one else’s.

"Scoring in the post is not just for the “bigs” in basketball -- any player benefits from a strong post game. Some players feel they are playing more “like a guard” by avoiding the post by all means. Wrong -- Gary Payton, Michael Jordan, Dwyane Wade, Kobe Bryant, and even Tim Hardaway all used their posting skills when necessary to create opportunities on offense. The ability to create in the post only increases the ways in which you can attack the opponent and help your team. Why wouldʼt you want that in your bag of tricks?
 
Creating from the post moves you closer to the basket on offense, which is, theoretically, easier than scoring from the perimeter since you are initiating your attack from closer to the basket.

"The myth of the natural black athlete is widespread, though it’s usually talked about only when a sports commentator or celebrity embarrasses himself by bringing it up in public. Those gaffes are swiftly decried as racist, but apart from their link to the long history of ugly racial stereotypes about black people—especially men—they are also harmful because they obscure very real, hard-fought accomplishments. As Black Men Can’t Shoot demonstrates, such successes on the basketball court don’t happen just because of natural gifts—instead, they grow out of the long, tough, and unpredictable process of becoming a known player.
Scott Norman Brooks spent four years coaching summer league basketball in Philadelphia. And what he saw, heard, and felt working with the young black men on his team tells us much about how some kids are able to make the extraordinary journey from the ghetto to the NCAA. He tells the story of two young men, Jermaine and Ray, following them through their high school years and chronicling their breakthroughs and frustrations on the court as well as their troubles at home. Black Men Can’t Shoot is a moving coming-of-age story that counters the belief that basketball only exploits kids and lures them into following empty dreams—and shows us that by playing ball, some of these young black men have already begun their education even before they get to college.",0.0,$15.99,Sports & Outdoors,"Aug 01, 2009",598593055,University of Chicago Press,English,Black Men Can't Shoot,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/black-men-cant-shoot/id598593055?mt=11,,Scott N.

"Formed in 1904, the Alpha Physical Culture Club of Harlem was America’s first African American athletic club. Conrad Norman, its Jamaican-born founder, hoped to address rampant lung disease among blacks living in New York City’s overcrowded tenements by providing proper exercise facilities they could use without bias. The club’s basketball team, the Alpha Big Five, became nationally famous during the 1910s while sticking faithfully to the strictest amateur ideals.  West Indian sports promoters were controlling black basketball then, and favored this approach.  But the times were changing.  The Alpha’s version of pure sport for its own sake was threatened by new black fives with visions of play-for-pay, led by team owners like fellow Caribbean immigrant Robert Douglas. Which ideal would prevail? The future of basketball was at stake.
The author is the President and Executive Director of the Black Fives Foundation, which works to research, preserve, exhibit, and promote the pre-1950 history of African Americans in basketball to engage, teach, and inspire youth and others while honoring its pioneers and their descendants. 
The book includes a foreword by world renowned D.J., sneaker aficionado, publisher, voiceover artist, television personality, record label owner, writer, radio host, M.C., author, and film director Bobbito García.

"What does this program cover?

Speed 
Quickness 
Strength (without weights or equipment)
Core Power 
Conditioning 
Flexibility 
Agility

Engaging in a proper Strength Training and Conditioning program is just as important to perfect your body, as it is to improve your jumpshot!   Just knowing what to do to improve your game, and how to do it efficiently and properly, is half the battle! 
Strength Training and Conditioning movements can be performed with little or no weights at all!  The ability to improve strength without weights exists- you just have to learn proper form so that the body can move pain free and with the most range of motion to allow results to occur.  Using your own body weight utilizes so much core strength and power and it is some of the most intense type of strength workouts that can be done.  In fact, body weight training will also help facilitate an improvement in coordination, body awareness, and overall body balance.
All athletes have the ability to evolve into great players at their sport.  A few key concepts of determination, motivation, continual hard work, and a good attitude contribute to a strong mental base for performance enhancement.  The other essential element in the evolution of performance enhancement is to have an age-appropriate strength training program that will enhance the ability to perform at the highest level.
Having a proper strength and conditioning program should include dynamic flexibility, movement preparation, stability, strength movements, balance, functional core, agility & quickness drills, and powerful movements.  While building a solid base of muscle is part of the plan, the overall goal of in-season  strength training is maintenance.  In-season is not the time to try to build a muscular base or improve your power.  As a basketball player, you need your body to be able to be recovered from your workouts so that you can perform on game day.  Therefore, during season, your workouts should focus on endurance and quickness, strength and core maintenance, and flexibility for proper recovery.
Strength training for Basketball has evolved into a year-round program with periodized cycles that challenge and improve the body in a cycled pace off the court.  A meso-cycle consists of a series of weeks that work on improving certain modalities of training so that the body progresses efficiently throughout the season.  As the meso-cycle is completed, the next cycle will continue with a focus on different aspects of performance while keeping the strengths gained of the previous cycle.  This is so important to layer your training schedule so that you have a gradual progression of training as well as continual challenges that keep the body in the optimal condition throughout the season.
The workouts should be challenging, yet fun and in line with your goals.  Building great training habits and a solid foundation of efficient movement will make the extra difference from performing decently to performing outstandingly!
GOALS:
 Every athlete has their own set of goals that they want to improve and work on. 
What is your Goal(s)?
What do you need to do to accomplish them?

Other Goals:

Perform a (In- home if necessary) workout challenge with No Equipment on a regular basis & be able to see/ feel the results
Develop strength, speed & quickness, and stamina
Stay physically and mentally strong to prevent injury

"What do I do if Iʼm small?
 
My shot is always getting blocked...
 
Iʼm nervous about driving because the defenders are bigger...
 
 
First a disclaimer for all small players: your size is not an excuse in this game. If you suck as a player, no one cares that youʼre small, all they will know is that you suck. The goal in basketball is 10 feet high; naturally taller people have an advantage because they start off closer to that goal. And you know that before you even decide to play basketball. Once you lace up a pair of sneakers and step between those four lines, you are a player -- one who can play or one who cannot. I know tall players who canʼt play and I know smaller players who can ball. If youʼre going to be a basketball player, make your size and advantage and a resource to be utilized rather than an excuse or obstacle.

"What do I do if Iʼm small?
 
My shot is always getting blocked...
 
Iʼm nervous about driving because the defenders are bigger...
 
 
First a disclaimer for all small players: your size is not an excuse in this game. If you suck as a player, no one cares that youʼre small, all they will know is that you suck. The goal in basketball is 10 feet high; naturally taller people have an advantage because they start off closer to that goal. And you know that before you even decide to play basketball. Once you lace up a pair of sneakers and step between those four lines, you are a player -- one who can play or one who cannot. I know tall players who canʼt play and I know smaller players who can ball. If youʼre going to be a basketball player, make your size and advantage and a resource to be utilized rather than an excuse or obstacle.
 
This program is a series of drills and skills that an undersized player can use to be more effective on the floor in games. Creating space and scoring opportunities for yourself, and converting those situations to baskets (for passing, see the Passing Program).

"Possible ways of scoring in basketball are endless, and as long as more and more new players continue to pick up the game, there will always be new techniques for putting the ball in the basket. 
The purpose of this Handbook is to introduce you to a certain set of scoring moves -- not all that exist, which is not possible since there are new ways to score that come about every day. There will be more scoring moves Handbooks in the future, with more moves and ways to get points. Since there is already a Shooting Handbook, this Handbook will focus on scoring in the basket area, not outside scoring. 
Remember, there are only three rules in basketball: 
On Offense, score.
On Defense, prevent scoring.
At the end of the game, have more points than the opponent. 

Everything else is just details. As far as scoring moves go, you will be judged on their results -- did you score a basket or not? For the sake of efficiency and what we all face in live, 5x5 games, all the basket-area scoring moves worked on in this Handbook will be  executed within 3 dribbles (during the actual move; you may use some dribbles as you approach the move). We will also observe a universal, one-size-fits-all application of rules when it comes to footwork; what we call a great ‘first step’ or ‘hidden step’ in the American game (from the playgrounds to the NBA), is seen as a violation in FIBA-rules countries. All of the moves in this Handbook will invite no such conflicts. 
The moves and drills in this Handbook will get increasingly more challenging and intensive, and reps will increase. Your biggest emphasis in doing these workouts is not speed, how high you jump, or if you think a defender would steal/ block your move. Your emphasis is on technique. Pro basketball teams all have scouts; in post season play every team knows its opponents’ plays and actions. The best scorers have 4 or 5 moves that they use to average 20-30 points per contest for 82-100 games per season. Teams don't make entirely new play books in the playoffs, they execute those same plays so precisely that even a defense knowing what’s coming can’t stop it (Triangle Offense; Pick and Roll; Motion Offense). When you watch a game on TV, you rarely see a move done that’s never been done before -- it is just executed to perfection. This is your goal: execute your moves to perfection. Of course, no one is perfect, so your pursuit of being perfect never ends. Neither does the work you need to put into your game, no matter how good you are. 
Lastly, understand that there are no set moves that will always work in whatever situation. Players you face have different skills, experiences, and ways of playing. Your attack begins by taking what the defense gives you -- you must have enough skills to be able to take advantage, and enough experience/ practice to do so without thinking. The defender who cannot be scored on does not exist; only players who lack skills. 
Whether you can dunk or not, mix in layups, floaters and runners with your moves as you will not always be able to dunk in game situations. Dwyane Wade dunked 102 times in the 2010-11 season -- barely more than once per game -- and he scored in the mid-20s. Furthermore, DWade had more dunks last season than did LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Josh Smith, and Carmelo Anthony. Dunking does not happen as much as it seems. ",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644626687,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #6- Scoring Moves #1,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-6-scoring-moves/id644626687?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,12 Pages,Create and Score off the Dribble Driving to the Basket

"Basketball has a lock on the Filipino soul. From big arenas in Manila to makeshift hoops in small villages, basketball is played by Filipinos of all walks of life and is used to mark everything from summer breaks for students to religious festivals and many other occasions. Playing with the Big Boys traces the social history of basketball in the Philippines from an educational and “civilizing” tool in the early twentieth century to its status as national pastime since the country gained independence after World War II.  While the phrase “playing with the big boys” describes the challenge of playing basketball against outsized opponents, it also describes the struggle for recognition that the Philippines, as a subaltern society, has had to contend with in its larger transnational relationships as a former U.S. colony. Lou Antolihao goes beyond the empire-colony dichotomy by covering Filipino basketball in a wider range of comparisons, such as that involving the growing influence of Asia in its region, particularly China and Japan. In this context, Antolihao shows how Philippines basketball has moved from a vehicle for Americanization to a force for globalization in which the United States, while still a key player, is challenged by other basketball-playing countries.",0.0,$39.99,Basketball,"May 01, 2015",978911273,UNP - Nebraska,English,Playing with the Big Boys,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/playing-with-the-big-boys/id978911273?mt=11,,Lou Antolihao,The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska,288 Pages,"Basketball, American Imperialism, and Subaltern Discourse in the Philippines"

"If your interest in this book is in taking your fantasy basketball game to the next level then “Drinking and Drafting” might as well have been written for you personally! Fantasy basketball is a lot of fun, but it takes quite a bit of skill and effort to be a great manager. This book will help you know when and where to focus your efforts and how to best tweak your own approach to team management in order to fit your personal strengths / weakness.I’ve been playing fantasy basketball for more than a decade and over I’ve created multiple tools for team managers to analyze trades, compare players, and even analyze entire teams based on scheduling and other factors. I’m probably the only fantasy basketball author who has coded an entire fantasy basketball scoring system and hosted fantasy leagues on my own systems. The time I have spent studying fantasy basketball and the things I’ve learned through the development of my own systems is a big part what makes me comfortable writing this book. I decided that if I was to write a book for fantasy basketball managers then I wanted to go all. I set out to produce something that would show others the tricks of trade to become better players and that will provide huge value to readers, and this book is the culmination of that effort.A large portion of the book focuses on fantasy basketball ""strategery"" - the act of developing and carrying out a strategy. Yes, it's a bogus word - I know! The prominent use of the word in the title will hopefully be a sign to the reader that the book is written in a light hearted and down to earth way. But have no doubt that it is packed full of useful information for fantasy basketball managers.Here’s a quick listing of the types of things discussed:- Different fantasy basketball strategies and how to choose which one you want to use-How to initially rank players and how to customize / tweak your rankings- Drafting strategies- Team management tips for during the regular season, playoffs, and offseaon (keeperleagues)- Trade analysis fundamentals and how to maximize your chances of getting deals done- Lots more!“Drinking and Drafting” describes each phase of the fantasy basketball season from the preseason/offseason all the way up through the fantasy playoffs and tells you exactly what you should be doing during each phase to gain a competitive advantage. Those who are just getting in to fantasy basketball will certainly appreciate how the book is carefully broken down into manageable chunks representing each phase of the season. Following the advice presented will save new managers countless hours (and errors) and minimize many of the mistakes that are made by newcomers. Many of these mistakes have been historically made by just about everyone ever to play fantasy basketball. Just like in the Matrix - everyone falls the first time, but with this book you won’t actually have to make all of those “noob” mistakes.Seasoned fantasy basketball players will find proven ideas about what makes a fantasy basketball team successful and about how to maximize their own skills in each area of the game. There’s an abundance of information about how to identify your strengths and weaknesses as well as how to both choose and execute a strategy based on them.When you're done with “Drinking and Drafting” you’ll know more about fantasy basketball head-to-head strategy than you ever thought you would. You’ll also perform better once you start applying the concepts. You’ll know exactly what parts of your game you can improve and you’ll have actionable tips for how to make some of those improvements right away. In short, “Drinking and Drafting” will help you to realize and maximize your own skill, knowledge, creativity, mathematical, and optimization prowess in the realm of fantasy basketball.",0.0,$4.99,Games,"Sep 22, 2012",565158296,Josh Ahlstrom,English,Drinking and Drafting: Fantasy Basketball Strategery for Each Phase of the Game,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/drinking-drafting-fantasy/id565158296?mt=11,,Josh Ahlstrom,Smashwords,153 Pages,

"Pick up the pace with Coach Bobby Cremins' secrets for playing up-tempo ballWhen Bobby Cremins became head coach of Appalachian State University, he was one of the youngest professionals to ever lead an NCAA Division I basketball team. Going to Georgia Tech at 33, he was among the youngest ever in the history of the ACC.

"Being able to score from a post-up position is a useful skill for players of all sizes and positions. In the post you are starting your attack from a much closer position to the basket than when you are on the perimeter, which, practically speaking, makes your chances of scoring greater (see the shooting percentage leaders in the NBA -- always post players filling the top spots). 
Many times, a player who is taller than their teammates get placed in the post because they are the biggest player. This is not a negative situation to be in -- a good player is a good player at any position. Kobe Bryant and LeBron James both played center defensively for their high school teams. When LeBron’s high school team ran a set offense, LeBron was on the low block. Kobe was the tallest player on his HS team, and led them in blocked shots and rebounds. Did they complain? Kobe knew he was good; all he needed was to be in the game, period. This is the mindset of any good player. 
And, even when you are playing the position you wish to play, having the ability to score posting up will make you a valuable asset. 
The most important aspect of post scoring is footwork. Your footwork is the difference between an easy, make-able shot and a tough, well-defended, blocked or missed shot. 
Lastly, understand that there is not a set move or set of moves that will always work as you move up in the game. Opponents adjust and have different capabilities and experiences as you move from game to game. Never assume that what worked yesterday will work today. Have enough in your arsenal to take advantage of whatever the defense gives you. This is where your attack originates. ",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644631027,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #7- Post Moves,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-7-post-moves/id644631027?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,12 Pages,Scoring In the Post For Players of All Sizes

"Why the 1-4 High?
	Why run all of your set plays, quick hitters or entry plays from a 1-4 high set? Good question.
	Here are the reasons this alignment is great for all set plays:
	Less is more. This one set keeps things simple for your players.
	It creates excellent spacing. Offense is all about good spacing.
	This alignment creates good scoring opportunities for every position.
	It is easy to create plays for any type of shot necessary from this alignment.
	The plays can be run to either side of the court simply by running the mirror image of the play.
	It is very easy to get into from a numbered fast break system.
	It denies the defense from establishing its defensive priorities, making this alignment difficult to defend from the onset.
	What are defensive priorities? Regardless of the type of defense run, most traditional defensive systems want to establish the following priorities:
	Be able to apply tremendous pressure on the ball and provide help to the on-the-ball defender.
	Be able to provide help in any situation.
	Protect the rim and low post areas.
	Force the ball out of the middle to one side to establish a ball side and help side, allowing the defense to outnumber the offense 5-3 by virtue of the two help defenders.
	Defend two offensive players with one defender if possible (usually a zone defense).
	Establish good inside positioning for defensive rebound coverage.
	Clog the lane area with help defenders to prevent lane penetration via pass, cut or dribble; low post entry passes;backdoor cuts for lay-ups.
	Some of the ways the 1-4 high alignment prevents the defense from establishing its priorities include preventing the defense from being able to establish a help side defense,forcing the defense away from the lane area and rim, opening the area up for penetration of one form or another, and requiring the defense to guard each offensive player, including the ball, with only one defender, and operating the offense from the middle of the court to initiate the attack.
	In addition to the advantages the 1-4 high set denies the defense, it is versatile due to the fact all of the plays can be run as mirror images. Any play depicted being run to the right hand side of the court can be run in its mirror image on the left hand side of the court.
	This short book contains 30 plays to attack man-to-man defenses, zone defenses, to obtain 3-point shots, low post shots, and on-the-ball screens to create penetration opportunities.
	These simple plays are an excellent way to score after a time out, a dead ball or as an entry to motion or other offenses.",0.0,$4.99,Coaching,"Dec 16, 2013",788489198,Kevin Sivils,English,Coaching Basketball: 30 Set Plays and Quick Hitters for the 1-4 High Alignment,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/coaching-basketball-30-set/id788489198?mt=11,,Kevin Sivils,"Draft2Digital, LLC",38 Pages,
"In many game situations, your time and opportunity is limited -- you have to make quick decisions with the ball. The game moves quickly; the ball and the players right along with it.
When it comes to scoring, aim for efficiency -- creating and finishing your scoring opportunities efficiently will earn the trust of your coaches and teammates. Being able to score with two or fewer dribbles is scoring efficiency at its best.
One-Dribble scoring options were covered in the Triple Threat/ Jab Step Hoop Handbook. In this program we will cover two-dribble scoring options: ways to create and finish scoring opportunities with two or fewer bounces within the actual attack. There are some moves that will begin with an already-live dribble and other in which rhythm bounces will take you past two dribbles; the principle of scoring without wasted dribbles remains the goal.
The moves in the demonstration videos are done form certain areas of the floor, but you are not married to these areas. When you are working through the program, work in the areas that fit your game and the situations you (expect to) see.

"Interspersed throughout are Chalk Talks, in which I share some insights that I’ve gained during four decades of analyzing basketball, first as a player, and more recently as a trainer of middle school, junior high, high school, college, and professional players. You will always have an opponent who can run faster or jump higher than you. If you master these mental aspects of the game, you will always hold a critical advantage. When I work with players, I use progressions: first, develop a single skill (a crossover dribble, for example), then, implement a combination of skills (a crossover dribble, leading into a jump shot), then, test the skill in modified games (one-on-one, two-on-two, practice scrimmages), and then use it in regulation games.
With HoopLife: The Basketball Player's Max-Potential Handbook, you will learn to apply a similar discipline to your own self-improvement plan. You will learn that practicing alone is essential to your improvement, but that it’s just as important to play pick-up games, away from the judging eyes of parents and coaches, to try out those skills you have developed in isolation. Above all else, you will learn that in order to achieve your maximum potential as a player, you have to think like a point guard no matter where your coach tells you to play. You must strive to become what I call a TruePoint player, who leads your team and controls the game from wherever you’re positioned on the court. Though the destinations of every player are different, the journey is the same.

"Possible ways of scoring in basketball are endless, and as long as more and more new players continue to pick up the game, there will always be new techniques for putting the ball in the basket. 
The purpose of this Handbook is to introduce you to a certain set of scoring moves -- not all that exist, which is not possible since there are new ways to score that come about every day. There will be more scoring moves Handbooks in the future, with more moves and ways to get points. Since there is already a Shooting Handbook, this Handbook will focus on scoring in the basket area, not outside scoring. 
Remember, there are only three rules in basketball: 
On Offense, score.
On Defense, prevent scoring.
At the end of the game, have more points than the opponent. 

Everything else is just details. As far as scoring moves go, you will be judged on their results -- did you score a basket or not? For the sake of efficiency and what we all face in live, 5x5 games, all the basket-area scoring moves worked on in this Handbook will be  executed within 3 dribbles (during the actual move; you may use some dribbles as you approach the move). We will also observe a universal, one-size-fits-all application of rules when it comes to footwork; what we call a great ‘first step’ or ‘hidden step’ in the American game (from the playgrounds to the NBA), is seen as a violation in FIBA-rules countries. All of the moves in this Handbook will invite no such conflicts. 
The moves and drills in this Handbook will get increasingly more challenging and intensive, and reps will increase. Your biggest emphasis in doing these workouts is not speed, how high you jump, or if you think a defender would steal/ block your move. Your emphasis is on technique. Pro basketball teams all have scouts; in post season play every team knows its opponents’ plays and actions. The best scorers have 4 or 5 moves that they use to average 20-30 points per contest for 82-100 games per season. Teams don't make entirely new play books in the playoffs, they execute those same plays so precisely that even a defense knowing what’s coming can’t stop it (Triangle Offense; Pick and Roll; Motion Offense). When you watch a game on TV, you rarely see a move done that’s never been done before -- it is just executed to perfection. This is your goal: execute your moves to perfection. Of course, no one is perfect, so your pursuit of being perfect never ends. Neither does the work you need to put into your game, no matter how good you are. 
 
Lastly, understand that there are no set moves that will always work in whatever situation. Players you face have different skills, experiences, and ways of playing. Your attack begins by taking what the defense gives you -- you must have enough skills to be able to take advantage, and enough experience/ practice to do so without thinking. The defender who cannot be scored on does not exist; only players who lack skills. 
Whether you can dunk or not, mix in layups, floaters and runners with your moves as you will not always be able to dunk in game situations. Dwyane Wade dunked 102 times in the 2010-11 season -- barely more than once per game -- and he scored in the mid-20s. Furthermore, DWade had more dunks last season than did LeBron James, Derrick Rose, Josh Smith, and Carmelo Anthony. Dunking does not happen as much as it seems.",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644641228,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #9- Scoring Moves #2,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-9-scoring-moves/id644641228?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,9 Pages,Create and Score off the Dribble Driving to the Basket

"A revealing portrait of a once-in-a-generation athlete and global icon One of sport’s biggest superstars, Michael Jordan is more than an internationally renowned athlete. As illuminated through David Halberstam’s trademark balance of impeccable research and fascinating storytelling, Jordan symbolizes the apex of the National Basketball Association’s coming of age. Long before multimillion-dollar signings and lucrative endorsements, NBA players worked in relative obscurity, with most games woefully unattended and rarely broadcast on television. Then came Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, Jordan’s two great predecessors, and the game’s status changed. The new era capitalized on Jordan’s talent, will power, and unrivaled competiveness. In Playing for Keeps, Halberstam is at his investigative best, delving into Jordan’s expansive world of teammates and coaches. The result is a gripping story of the athlete and media powerhouse who changed a game forever. This ebook features an extended biography of David Halberstam.“How good is this book? Well, let’s put it this way: Michael Jordan is the David Halberstam of basketball.” —USA Today “What David Halberstam delivers—and what the reader has come to expect from Halberstam—is insight, balance, analysis.” —The New York TimesDavid Halberstam (1934–2007) was a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and bestselling author. He is best known for both his courageous coverage of the Vietnam War for the New York Times, as well as for his twenty-one nonfiction books—which cover a wide array of topics, from the plight of Detroit and the auto industry to the captivating origins of baseball’s fiercest rivalry. Halberstam wrote for numerous publications throughout his career and, according to journalist George Packer, single-handedly set the standard of “the reporter as fearless truth teller.” Halberstam died in 2007.  ",4.0,$9.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Dec 18, 2012",582509577,Open Road Media,English,Playing for Keeps,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/playing-for-keeps/id582509577?mt=11,4.0,David Halberstam,"OpenRoad Integrated Media, LLC",432 Pages,Michael Jordan and the World He Made

"Find out where to play and what to expect in this street-smart and entertaining b-ball bible For the millions of roundball junkies who are not in the NBA or the new WNBA, hoop dreams are lived out on playgrounds and in old gyms, in informal games that can be every bit as competitive as their big-league counterparts, no matter what the level of play. This is pick-up basketball, America's favorite way to play its favorite game. Hoops Nation is the result of former college-basketball player Chris Ballard's six-month quest by van to find the best pick-up basketball games in the country. Entries from all forty-eight mainland states break down the key points of each game site, including level of play, number of hoops, playing surface, whether women play, average age of players, and whether night play is an option. Ballard also gives the entertaining low down on local basketball culture, lore, and etiquette. At-a-glance symbols for each court make for easy reference, and interspersed throughout are lively sections and sidebars on topics such as dunking technique, the pick-up court hall of fame, slang, and more.

"It isn’t like the Dallas Mavericks winning the NBA title in June was a big secret, but until now no one within the NBA was talking about basketball and everyone outside the sport was only talking about the lack thereof. 
 
But now it is back to business as usual and everyone is clamoring about the NBA. Talk of the upcoming season is as prominent as Christmas at Starbucks. The NBA chatter is focused on the upcoming season and whether the Mavericks have the legs to repeat as champions or if the Miami Heat will come back with more fire than ever to take back what they already knew was theirs in August of 2010.
 
No one is breaking the radio silence more clearly than Dallas Sports talk host Bob Sturm. Sturm isn’t focused on the upcoming season. He wants everyone to know exactly how the Mavericks pulled off their magical championship run last year. Through extensive interviews and covering the Mavericks as a passionate journalist, Sturm illuminates what exactly brought the Mavericks together as a team—a team that won 57 regular season games and compiled playoff series victories over Portland, Los Angeles, and Oklahoma City before taking the home the Larry O’Brien Trophy from the Finals by convincingly defeating the Miami Heat.
THIS YEAR IS DIFFERENT covers all the important details of the Dallas Mavericks' 2011 championship season, including: 
- The transformation of the Dallas Mavericks franchise from perennial loser to NBA powerhouse.
- Dirk Nowitzki's career-long battle to cement his dynasty with an NBA championship, including a bitter loss in the 2006 Finals to Dwyane Wade's Miami Heat.
- Tracing the ups and downs of the 2011 campaign, as the Mavs soared to the top of the standings, only to suffer critical injuries mid-season and a string of losses which threatened their playoff hopes.
- A game-by-game recap of the Mavericks' 2011 playoff run, as they battled through the quarter-, semi-, and Western Conference Finals for a chance to compete for the NBA championship. 
- The epic story of the 2011 NBA Finals, as Nowitzki and the Mavs took on Miami's ""Big Three,"" in a rematch of Dallas' heartbreaking loss in the 2006 Finals, and how the Mavericks overcame all odds to win their first NBA Championship.",4.5,$2.99,Basketball,"Dec 12, 2011",489183464,Diversion Books,English,This Year Is Different,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/this-year-is-different/id489183464?mt=11,4.52632,Bob Sturm,Diversion Publishing Corp.,213 Pages,How The Mavs Won It All: The Official Story
"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER   Acclaimed sports journalist Jack McCallum delivers the untold story of  the greatest team ever assembled: the 1992 U.S. Olympic Men’s Basketball  Team. As a writer for Sports Illustrated, McCallum enjoyed a  courtside seat for the most exciting basketball spectacle on earth,  covering the Dream Team from its inception to the gold medal ceremony in  Barcelona. Drawing on fresh interviews with the players, McCallum  provides the definitive account of the Dream Team phenomenon. He offers a  behind-the-scenes look at the controversial selection process. He takes  us inside the team’s Olympic suites for late-night card games and bull  sessions where superstars like Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry  Bird debated the finer points of basketball. And he narrates a riveting  account of the legendary intrasquad scrimmage that pitted the Dream  Teamers against one another in what may have been the greatest pickup  game in history. In the twenty years since the Dream Team first  captivated the world, its mystique has only grown.

"The jumpstop or pro-hop move is a common scoring move you’ll see in pro and college basketball; it allows the ball handler to gather herself and have balance before finishing her play with a pass or shot. Used properly, the jumpstop can create space for the ball handler, initiate contact on scoring opportunities, free the ball handler from a crowd of defenders, and more -- there is not a limit to what you can accomplish with a total grasp of any skill in the game. 
This program will have you working on a bevy of scoring moves and techniques, all  utilizing the jumpstop. All reps and sets are counted in made baskets and not attempts. 
Pay attention to the Jumpstop Tutorial below and be sure you are executing the move properly, so in live game situations your movements will come naturally and without hesitation. 
The moves in the demonstration videos are done form certain areas of the floor, but you are not married to these areas. When you are working through the program, work in the areas that fit your game and the situations you (expect to) see.

"The wonderfully original story of a struggling Chinese basketball team and its quixotic, often comical attempt to right its fortunes by copying the American stars of the NBA—a season of cultural misunderstanding that transcends sports and reveals China’s ambivalent relationship with the West.   When the Shanxi Brave Dragons, one of China’s worst professional basketball teams, hired former NBA coach Bob Weiss, the team’s owner, Boss Wang, promised that Weiss would be allowed to Americanize his players by teaching them “advanced basketball culture.” That promise would be broken from the moment Weiss landed in China. Desperate for his team to play like Americans, Wang—a peasant turned steel tycoon—nevertheless refused to allow his players the freedom and individual expression necessary to truly change their games.   Former New York Times Beijing bureau chief Jim Yardley tells the story of the resulting culture clash with sensitivity and a keen comic sensibility. Readers meet the Brave Dragons, a cast of colorful, sometimes heartbreaking oddballs from around the world: the ambitious Chinese assistant coach, Liu Tie, who believes that Chinese players are genetically inferior and can improve only through the repetitious drilling once advocated by ancient kung fu masters; the moody and selfish American import, Bonzi Wells, a former NBA star so unnerved by China that initially he locks himself in his apartment; the Taiwanese point guard, Little Sun, who is demonized by his mainland Chinese coaches; and the other Chinese players, whose lives sometimes seem little different from those of factory workers.    As readers follow the team on a fascinating road trip through modern China—from glamorous Shanghai and bureaucratic Beijing to the booming port city Tianjin and the polluted coal capital of Taiyuan—we see Weiss learn firsthand what so many other foreigners in China have discovered: China changes only when and how it wants to change.",4.5,$11.99,Basketball,"Feb 14, 2012",438096006,Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group,English,Brave Dragons,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/brave-dragons/id438096006?mt=11,4.61905,Jim Yardley,"Random House, LLC",336 Pages,"A Chinese Basketball Team, an American Coach, and Two Cultures Clashing"

"Only two seasons into his professional career, Bradley Beal is already known as one of the toughest scorers around at the 2-guard position. After a decorated All-American high school career, Bradley entered the NBA after just one year of NCAA ball and showed he was the real deal right off the bat. 
Teaming with point guard John Wall, Beal and Wall took the Wizards to the second round of the NBA Playoffs for the first time in a long time in the spring of 2014. 
This Signature Workout program focuses on some of Brad Beal’s best in-game offensive skills, such as:
	•	Knock-Down Catch-And-Shoot Skills
	•	One-And Two-Dribble Pullup Jumper Moves
	•	Attacking The Rim On Hard Closeouts Off The Catch

The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over

One boy learns the game from his father. Another gets a lesson from his mother, who can dunk like no one else. A rookie in the pros gets battered by his new teammates before winning their respect. A high school girl finds strength and and glimmers of her sexuality through the game. A young man plays a game against the devil himself. One man sees just how good extraterrestrials are at the game, much to his abiding awe. One man tells the story of a blind player who could still sink a jumper.
Basketball is a far-reaching metaphor, embodying life, love, mortality, and all our hopes and aspirations. These poems and stories contain the game in so many permutations that no one who ever played will fail to see their game herein. FULL COURT is a big, crowded, animated, artful game of basketball, one that never ends.

PRAISE FOR FULL COURT
""From John Edgar Wideman to Bobbie Ann Mason to Sherman Alexie, Trudell presents the best in recent basketball fiction and poetry."" —L. A. Weekly
""Full Court allows you to contemplate the beauty of this very American game without the glow of the television and the noise of the arena. Basketball is a worthy subject for serious literature."" —Orlando Sentinel
""A welcome addition to the sports fiction genre."" —Los Angeles Times
""This ambitious collection of poems and stories shows that hoops, too, can be a writerly muse.... The best pieces chosen by Trudell use the game in daring and revealing ways."" —Publishers Weekly
""It's fairly amazing the number of poets and fiction writers drawn to the sport, including Sherman Alexie, Edward Hirsch, Bobbie Ann Mason, William Matthews, Leonard Michaels, John Sayles, and John Edgar Wideman."" —Memphis Commercial Appeal
""Dennis Trudell has secured some of the finest and most illuminating examples of basketball short fiction and poetry produced over the last twenty-five years into one splendid book.... The works under consideration here are most compelling examples of the power of basketball to command the imagination, to be what every sport needs to survive the momentary electricity of competition and sweaty hustle: an occasion to observe the human character under extreme intensity, an occasion to learn about ourselves, an occasion to exercise the vast capacity of the human imagination to invent."" —Aethlon

""The stories are a potpourri of small triumphs and heartbreaking defeats, extravagant matches and fantastic premises: A blind player is still able to hit jump shots, a player takes on the devil, and a slow-witted `natural' is bested in an intramural game that haunts him the rest of his life. Tragedy and victory mix like spilled blood on the court; personal bests attain mythic dimensions."" —Isthmus
""Perhaps what Full Court ultimately teaches is a two pointer: that the game is most satisfying when played in the arena of the imagination, and that good sports writing is always simply good writing, period.""
—Cleveland Plain Dealer

"“A breezy, cautionary tale for modern sports fans” (Booklist) of the Brooklyn Nets’ inaugural season, which brought back pro sports to the borough of Brooklyn—now updated to include the 2013-2014 season.When the Brooklyn Nets played their first game at Barclays Center in downtown Brooklyn in the fall of 2012, they succeeded in bringing professional sports back to Brooklyn for the first time since the Dodgers abandoned the borough in 1957.Brooklyn Bounce chronicles the Nets’ historic inaugural season in the borough, full of highs and lows—plenty of them entirely unexpected. Sports journalist Jake Appleman takes us inside the locker room and courtside, examining the team’s transition from the New Jersey swamp to gentrified Brooklyn, from an opening night delayed by Hurricane Sandy to an epic seven-game playoff showdown with the Chicago Bulls.The Nets were the game’s foremost paradox in 2013, a team that managed to be the most improved in the NBA, but also consistently disappointed. What made them interesting wasn’t their style of play or even their unique collection of personalities; it was their constant state of reinvention and their evolving relationship with their new home: as the Barclays crowds would chant it, BROOOOOOK-LYN! Here, “Appleman’s wit, enthusiasm for his subject, and familiarity with the players lifts Brooklyn Bounce above most season chronicles” (The Boston Globe).",0.0,$11.99,Basketball,"Feb 04, 2014",668394594,Scribner,English,Brooklyn Bounce,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/brooklyn-bounce/id668394594?mt=11,,Jake Appleman,Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc.,256 Pages,The Highs and Lows of Nets Basketball’s Historic First Season in the Borough
"This book presents several good reasons why some basketball rules should be changed to make the game much fairer and more enjoyable. Many people are so used to the present rules that they think that they are hardened in stone and just part of the game. This is easily proven to be wrong by reading all of the changes in basketball rules over the past 100 years. An appendix lists the major changes for the reader’s edification.The two major rules discussed are intentional fouls near the end of many games and the fouling out rule. Intentional fouling in the last minute of many games is usually disliked greatly by most basketball fans, but accepted grudgingly as part of the game. The team that commits intentional fouls may gain by doing so, and has little to lose. On the other hand, the team that is intentionally fouled has little to gain and possibly may lose by being fouled. This situation is definitely not right or logical. It should always be the other way around. If anyone is to benefit, it should be the team that is fouled. Under the present rules, the team that is ahead has no time to run their offense and take time off the clock. Their offense is often limited to only one second. The entire flow (or lack of flow) is controlled by the team that has committed a foul on purpose. Also, repeated time outs and time to shoot all the fouls may make the last minute of play take 20 minutes of real time. An original suggestion for changing the rule is offered. This rule change is much fairer than the present rules. An important point is that a team that has fairly built a lead in the first 39 minutes of the game should not be possibly penalized by unfair rules concerning intentional fouls in the last minute.A special situation concerning intentional fouls occurs with under 15 seconds left in the game, and the leading team is ahead by one point and about to throw the ball in. They are usually fouled intentionally right away. They must take 1 or 2 fouls shots, and the team that fouled them now gets the ball back with a chance to tie or win the game. This is extremely unfair. They should not have the right to get the ball back by fouling on purpose.The fouling out rule is also very unfair at times. Often a star player is charged with his second personal foul after only a few minutes of play, and ends up sitting on the bench for up to 15 minutes. Yet TV replays may show that a foul called by the referee was wrong. This is a great injustice. Similarly, a minor foul or incorrect call on a third or fourth foul may make the player sit on the bench for many minutes. Basketball seems to be the only major sport in which minor infractions can lead to expulsion from the game. Several options are offered that will improve the rules concerning fouling out of the game.Changing the rules about when time outs can be called will reward good defensive play. Specific situations and changes are explained.The shot clock in men’s college basketball has been 35 seconds since 1993. Some people think this should be reduced to 24 seconds, as is the rule in the NBA and international basketball, or to 30 seconds, as in women’s college basketball. A discussion follows with reasons for and against changing the shot clock. Another idea is to change the 10 second rule for bringing the ball across the center line to only 8 seconds. This would make the game more exciting.The final chapter discusses how to improve the use of instant replay in college basketball. Several suggestions are made to make the game fairer and the referees’ calls more accurate.The overall principle emphasized in the book is fairness. Changing a few rules will make the game much fairer..",0.0,$2.99,Basketball,"Feb 19, 2014",826435110,Arnold Popkin,English,How to Fix Basketball Games,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/how-to-fix-basketball-games/id826435110?mt=11,,Arnold Popkin,Smashwords,81 Pages,
"An expose of sexual recruiting tactics from the journal pages of an escort queen.
Breaking Cardinal Rules is an exposé by escort Katina Powell based on her experiences providing sexual services for the basketball program at the University of Louisville. It is written with Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Dick Cady.
Powell has filled five journals with details of her escort escapades, sexual encounters and her activities at the University of Louisville. Most of the U of L services she provided took place in the men's dormitory where most of the basket players reside.
Her main contact and the man with the money–the school's former director of basketball operations and former graduate assistant, Andre McGee–kept Powell and her girls busy from 2010 to 2014.
Powell does not present a sympathetic character. Her life is full of contradictions. She has no remorse over the choices she has made. Her story is true in all its graphic detail.
""If you think you've heard seamy tales about recruiting before, wait till you get a load of this. The Louisville high command has vowed to take the matter very seriously. It should.""

"The National Basketball Association used to be a unifi ed league featuring
high powered teams with great players who put on explosive shows
night after night to the delight of their admiring fans.
The league featured great stars like Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Elgin
Baylor, and Jerry West who consistently displayed offensive versatility
as well as defensive prowess. The NBA of some 50 years ago had no
more than six or eight teams, but all of them were highly skilled
and explosive.
But today the NBA has fallen on hard timesat least in the artistic sense.
In his new book How Sweet It Was: And How the NBA Can Return to
Greatness, writer Joe Delmore outlines what made the league great and
how it has fallen from those graces. He pays particular attention to the
overpaid athletes, coaches with no authority, and selfi sh players with
poorly developed basketball skills. The media, particularly cable television,
shines a constant spotlight on these overcompensated athletes.
In his new book, the author outlines several concrete steps that should
return professional basketball to a semblance of its former glory. Players
will receive better training and more classroom exposure, and contracts
will be limited by their very nature. The author also outlines steps on how
to improve the coaching profession.
If these measures are undertaken, a revitalized NBA will take shape, and
fans will gain a new appreciation of the game.",0.0,$9.99,Basketball,"Jun 30, 2011",454453714,Xlibris,English,How Sweet It Was,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/how-sweet-it-was/id454453714?mt=11,,Joe Delmore,"Author Solutions, Inc.",169 Pages,AND HOW THE NBA CAN RETURN TO GREATNESS
"The inspirational and touching story of Gonzaga's rise from college basketball obscurity to near mythic status as everyone's favorite underdog, this book was penned by acclaimed college basketball writer Bud Withers, who has covered the Zags since it all began. In dramatic fashion he reanimates the events of the last few years, adding flesh to the personalities and summoning the details, great and small, that make up this unforgettable story. Readers will meet players such as Blake Stepp, a blue chip high school recruit who selected Gonzaga because of what it wasn't ; Dan Dickau, who became a first-round NBA pick in 2002 after becoming Gonzaga's first All-American player in the history of the men's basketball program;  Dan Monson, the former coach who instilled a fearless attitude among the players and began Gonzaga's storied run; Mark Few, the current coach who has continued and expanded upon the program's great success; and Father Tony Lehmann, the school's longtime chaplain who died in March 2002, who was the inspirational leader of the basketball team. This book is a must read for any college basketball fan wanting to know more about Gonzaga, the team that makes deep runs into the NCAA tournament almost every year without compromising on the small-school values that still separate it from the basketball factories it terrorizes each March.",0.0,$13.99,Basketball,"Sep 01, 2002",674112317,Triumph Books,English,BraveHearts,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/bravehearts/id674112317?mt=11,,Bud Withers,"Chicago Review Press, Inc.

"Before Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Julius Erving, or Michael Jordan––before Magic Johnson and Showtime––the Harlem Globetrotters revolutionized basketball and spread the game around the world. In Spinning the Globe, author Ben Green tells the story of this extraordinary franchise and iconic American institution.

Green brings to life their struggles with racism and segregation, and their influence upon a nation's views about race and sport. We witness the Globetrotters' fall from grace to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 1990s, and their ultimate rebirth under Mannie Jackson today, as they once again amaze kids and families around the world.

Herren was heavily recruited by major universities, chosen as a McDonald's All-American, featured in a Sports Illustrated cover story, and at just seventeen years old became the central figure in Fall River Dreams, an acclaimed book about the 1994 Durfee team's quest for the state championship.              Leaving Fall River for college, Herren starred on Jerry Tarkanian's Fresno State Bulldogs team of talented misfits, which included future NBA players as well as future convicted felons. His gritty, tattooed, hip-hop persona drew the ire of rival fans and more national attention: Rolling Stone profiled him, 60 Minutes interviewed him, and the Denver Nuggets drafted him. When the Boston Celtics acquired his contract, he lived the dream of every Massachusetts kid--but off the court Herren was secretly crumbling, as his alcohol and drug use escalated and his life spiraled out of control.            Twenty years later, Chris Herren was married to his high-school sweetheart, the father of three young children, and a heroin junkie. His basketball career was over, consumed by addictions; he had no job, no skills, and was a sadly familiar figure to those in Fall River who remembered him as a boy, now prowling the streets he once ruled, looking for a fix. One day, for a time he cannot remember, he would die.             In his own words, Chris Herren tells how he nearly lost everything and everyone he loved, and how he found a way back to life. Powerful, honest, and dramatic, Basketball Junkie is a remarkable memoir, harrowing in its descent, and heartening in its return.",4.5,$9.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"May 10, 2011",415986194,St. Martin's Press,English,Basketball Junkie,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/basketball-junkie/id415986194?mt=11,4.64247,Chris Herren & Bill Reynolds,"Macmillan / Holtzbrinck Publishers, LLC",250 Pages,A Memoir

"The jump shot is the most important play in basketball and its inception revolutionized the game, spearheading an increase in scoring and bolstering the sport's popularity. Rise and Fire celebrates this crucial shot while tracing its history and shedding light on all corners of the basketball world, from the biggest NBA arenas to the playgrounds of New York City and the barns of Indiana. Part history, part travelogue, and part memoir, award-winning journalist Shawn Fury praises the jump shot, puzzles over its complexities, and marvels over its simplicity. Impeccably researched and engaging, Fury bounces from the dirt courts of the first shooters of the 1930s to today's NBA courts and state-of-the-art shooting labs, examining everything from how nets and rims affect a shooter to rivalries between shooting coaches to how the three-pointer came to rule the game. The book traces how the jump shot changed basketball history, with interviews and profiles of legendary figures like Jerry West, Rick Mount, Bob McAdoo, Ray Allen, and dozens more, including the first woman ever drafted by the NBA. Fury visits Bobby Plump, the small-town kid who hit the jump shot that inspired the movie Hoosiers; talks with Kenny Sailors, the 93-year-old father of the modern jumper; and pays homage to Denise Long and Jeanette Olson who put on one of the greatest shooting displays ever one night in Iowa in 1968.Analyzing the techniques and re-creating legendary plays from the greats-like Larry Bird, Pistol Pete, and Kobe Bryant-as well as lesser-known talents, Fury creates a technical, personal, historical, and even spiritual examination of the shot. This is not a dry how-to textbook of basketball mechanics-this is a lively tour of basketball history and a love letter to the sport and the shot that changed it forever.",0.0,,Basketball,"Feb 23, 2016",1025799557,Flatiron Books,English,Rise and Fire,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/rise-and-fire/id1025799557?mt=11,,Shawn Fury,250 Pages,English,"The Origins, Science, and Evolution of the Jump Shot---and How It Transformed Basketball Forever"

"With eleven championship rings to his name, Phil Jackson is internationally recognized as one of the greatest coaches in the history of the NBA. Known as a defensive disrupter and a master fouler during his early days as a New York Knick and later celebrated as the “Zen Master” for his inspirational tactics as a leader, Jackson has had a long and storied career marked by constant self-reflection and reinvention. This is the man who led Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to six championships, Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers to five; who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame; and who retired in 2011, an official legend—and the most sought-after free-agent coach in history.            As befits a legend, Jackson has written several candid, insightful books about his life and career, but now one of America’s most respected sportswriters turns an unvarnished light on Jackson’s strange and remarkable journey, from his sheltered childhood and adolescence in Montana and North Dakota, through his years playing at Madison Square Garden, to his experiences coaching Jordan, Bryant, and more of the greatest players of our time.

"The definitive biography of basketball genius Julius Erving--the icon who transcended his sport and defined an eraJulius Erving, aka Dr. J, was a wizard with the basketball, performing feats the world had never seen before: midair spins and whirls punctuated by powerful slam dunks, which he was the first to glamorize. In a career that lasted from the 1970s well into the 1980s, he was one of the first players to make extemporaneous individual expression an integral part of the game, setting the style of play that has prevailed ever since. He's also long been respected as a gracious, dignified, and disciplined man. As there are great men of history, there are great men of sports, and Dr. J is just such a man.This book tells Dr. J's amazing story, following his basketball journey from his Long Island childhood to the street games of New York City to a college career as his skills, reputation, and character grew. It follows his entrance into the ABA, where he revolutionized the game by glamorizing the dunk, and his conquering of the NBA, where he was Michael Jordan before there was a Jordan. It relates the family struggles he's had since leaving the game and charts the transformation of the man into myth.The first complete biography of one of the greatest and most popular basketball players of all timeDraws on interviews with Dr. J's childhood friends and his family to teammates and coaches at all levelsWritten by a New York Times sports journalist and author of Asphalt Gods: An Oral History of the Rucker TournamentIncludes Erving's years as a player with the Virginia Squires, New York Nets, and Philadelphia 76ersRead Doc and follow the incredible journey of the basketball genius who elevated the game off the hardwood and helped make it America's passion.",0.0,$16.99,Basketball,"Oct 08, 2009",635416120,Turner Publishing Company,English,Doc,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/doc/id635416120?mt=11,,Vincent Mallozzi,Ingram DV LLC,320 Pages,The Rise and Rise of Julius Erving
"The further you advance in the game, the better your competition will be. The most significant difference between levels of basketball is not the players in the 6’5”-and-under range. There and many guards playing overseas and in the D-League that could easily be the 9th or 10th man on an NBA roster, and the reverse is also true. 
The biggest difference when moving up levels in basketball is the skill and size of the bigs (power forwards & centers). They get bigger, faster, smarter and react quicker. You must adjust. And unless you’re LeBron James or Blake Griffin, you won’t be able to dunk on all of them, every time you drive. You must be able to finish scoring forays with a variety of techniques, and create space from bigger opponents trying to block your way path.

After his collegiate coaching career, Rose coached with five NBA teams: San Antonio Spurs, New Jersey Nets, Milwaukee Bucks, Charlotte Hornets, and Charlotte Bobcats.

"Pete Marvich might not have been the greatest basketball player of his generation, but he was unquestionably the most exciting and entertaining. A magician at handling or shooting the ball and the most prolific scorer in college basketball history, “Pistol Pete"" was as recognizable as he was flashy. If the mop of brown hair and floppy gray socks didn't give him away, the behind-the-back dribbling and between the-legs passes did. Maravich first captured the nation's attention while playing basketball for his father at Louisiana State University, averaging an incredible 44.2 points per game over three years and earning college player-of-the-year honors in 1970. He went on to play for ten years in the NBA for the Atlanta Hawks, New Orleans Jazz, and Boston Celtics, garnering NBA First Team honors twice and Second Team honors two other times. In 1976-77 he led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points, including a 68-point outburst in a game against the New York Knicks. ""Pistol Pete"" was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1987. Less than a year later, at the age of 40, he collapsed while playing basketball with friends and died an hour later. While he has been gone for more than fifteen years, his on-court showmanship and of-court charisma endure for millions of basketball fans who fondly remember him. In ""Pete Maravich: Magician of the Hardwood,” players, coaches, friends, fans, and relatives recall the soft-spoken man who turned away from heavy drinking and turned toward God.

"This is the inspirational story of Ted Owens—still the coach with the most wins in the history of Allen Fieldhouse—from growing up as a boy on a cotton farm in Southwestern Oklahoma during the Great Depression to coaching at the highest levels of the college basketball world. “At the end of each day on the farm, we would  gure the total weight of the cotton we had pulled. We called it the “hang-up,” says Owens. One day, in a competition to see who could pull the most cotton, Owens was leading his father, who then gave him the greatest life lesson: “It’s not what you have now that is important, it’s what you have at the hang-up.” He always reminded Ted that regardless of your station in life, whether encountering di culties or enjoying success, you should never lose sight of your ultimate goals. At the age of 5, Owens made his  rst basketball goal, lifting the basketball from between his legs in an underhand scooping motion. It was at that moment that basketball became his  rst love, a feeling he still embraces today. He went on to play at the University of Oklahoma for Naismith Hall of Fame Coach Bruce Drake, and he witnessed the rise of national championship programs led by football coach Bud Wilkinson, wrestling coach Port Robertson and baseball coach Jack Baer. This book is a story of the survival of a family built upon love, sacri ce, and the importance of family strength. The book also shares the ups and downs of building a coaching career and the tale of coaching basketball at the University of Kansas for 19 seasons. Owens’ teams won 206 games in Allen Fieldhouse, a number that still leads Roy Williams (201), Bill Self and Larry Brown. He coached some of the era’s greatest players while leading the Jayhawks against Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Joe Lapchick, Henry Iba, Dean Smith, Eddie Sutton, Bob Knight and John Wooden.

In the counting section of the book, Dick leads kids in counting using colorful basketballs. The book has a special feature (may not be available on all e-readers): a video introduction by Dick Vitale and digital audio clips for all 26 letters in Vitale’s own voice ""broadcasting"" different phrases to encourage the child, including ""You and Me-What a Team"" and Vitale's signature catchphrase: ""You're Awesome, Baby!"" The book is illustrated with a colorful menagerie of animal characters and a tiny little version of Dickie V.

"If you plan on being a basketball player that is taken seriously, to you there will be no such thing as a “weak hand.” 
For those unfamiliar with the terminology, your ‘weak hand’ (which is what it will be referred to throughout this Handbook, even though our goal is eliminate ‘weak’ hands) is the hand you don’t write or shoot jumpers with, generally speaking. If you are right-handed, your left is your weak hand. 
You should be able to do everything -- dribble, pass, finish around the basket -- with both hands close to equally. The only thing your non-dominant hand won’t be great at (or used at all for) is shooting jumpshots. 
This Handbook will address your weak hand’s ball handling (Ball Handling is also covered in more detail in the Ball Handling Hoop Handbook) and finishing abilities. Passing is covered in the Passing Mini-Handbook. These drills will assume the workouts of a right handed player -- making the left hand our focus. If you are left-handed, simply switch the direction and hands used in each drill.",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Nov 01, 2011",644666459,Dre Baldwin,English,HoopHandbook #12- Left/Weak Hand,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/hoophandbook-12-left-weak/id644666459?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,12 Pages,Develop Your Non-Dominant Hand to the Same Level As Your String Hand

"The six rules of success that launched Jeremy Lin from underdog to NBA superstarIn Win Like Lin, award-winning sports writer Sean Deveney, breaks down Jeremy Lin’s winning game plan to help you create your own success story.Before he joined the New York Knicks, Harvard-graduate Jeremy Lin had been cut from two teams and passed over by virtually every other NBA franchise. And for his first month in New York, he sat on the bench. Then Jeremy Lin got his chance on the court—and pro basketball hasn’t been the same.Combining the remarkable story of Lin’s improbable rise with interviews of today’s top NBA players, coaches, and team executives—including Amare Stoudemire, Dwayne Wade, Mike D’Antoni, and Steve Kerr—Deveney outlines the six principles Lin applied to beat the odds and rise to the top:Don’t be afraid to take the road less traveledBelieve in your own abilityFind the system that works best for youFocus on making the most of skills you already possessRebound quickly from setbacks and learn from failureBe humble in victoryAthletic prowess is only part of the Jeremy Lin saga.

"As part of the acclaimed Sports Virtues series, Clarence ""Big House"" Gaines, Sr.: Respectability discusses the struggles and triumphs of Clarence Gaines’ life.

Each story is followed by a small quotation from literature to amplify the meaning and application of the virtue, and each story is also followed by a series of study/review questions and other interactive activities to help the reader further understand the virtue and how to achieve it.

"During the 1972–1973 basketball season, the Philadelphia 76ers were not just a bad team; they were fantastically awful. Doomed from the start after losing their leading scorer and rebounder, Billy Cunningham, as well as head coach Jack Ramsay, they lost twenty-one of their first twenty-three games. A Philadelphia newspaper began calling them the Seventy Sickers, and they duly lost their last thirteen games on their way to a not-yet-broken record of nine wins and seventy-three losses. Charley Rosen recaptures the futility of that season through the firsthand accounts of players, participants, and observers. Although the team was uniformly bad, there were still many memorable moments, and the lore surrounding the team is legendary. Once, when head coach Lou Rubin tried to substitute John Q. Trapp out of a game, Trapp refused and told Rubin to look behind the team’s bench, whereby one of Trapp’s friends supposedly opened his jacket to show his handgun. With only four wins at the All-Star break, Rubin was fired and replaced by player-coach Kevin Loughery. In addition to chronicling the 76ers’ woes, Perfectly Awful also captures the drama, culture, and attitude of the NBA in an era when many white fans believed that the league had too many black players. ",0.0,$12.99,United States,"Oct 01, 2014",906170156,UNP - Nebraska,English,Perfectly Awful,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/perfectly-awful/id906170156?mt=11,,Charley Rosen,The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska,176 Pages,The Philadelphia 76ers' Horrendous and Hilarious 1972-1973 Season

"‘Basketbal werd werk. De tijd nadat na het avondeten nog uren op een pleintje werden doorgebracht was definitief voorbij.’ 
Rik Smits (Eindhoven, 1966) was jarenlang ons meest succesvolle exportproduct in de Verenigde Staten: een Nederlandse speler in de sterkste en hardste basketbalcompetitie ter wereld, de NBA. Nederland kende hem voor namelijk als best betaalde sporter van eigen bodem. Rik Smits - Dunking Dutchman beschrijft de lange weg die Smits moest afleggen voordat hij in 1988 zijn eerste profcontract bij Indiana Pacers kon tekenen, en de hindernissen die hij moest nemen voordat het publiek in Indianapolis hem in de armen sloot.
Tim Overdiek sprak met Smits’ familie, met zijn (voormalige) medespelers, coaches en begeleiders, en vanzelfsprekend met Rik Smits zelf. Uit deze gesprekken is een fascinerend boek ontstaan over de harde Amerikaanse sportwereld en de belevenissen daarin van een nuchtere Hollandse sportman.

Joe “The Destroyer” Hammond. Richard “Pee Wee” Kirkland. These and dozens of other colorfully nicknamed men are the “Asphalt Gods,” whose astounding exploits in the Rucker Tournament, often against multimillionaire NBA superstars, have made them playground divinity. First established in the 1950s by Holcombe Rucker, a New York City Parks Department employee, the tournament has grown to become a Harlem institution, an annual summer event of major proportions. On that fabled patch of concrete, unknown players have been lighting it up for decades as they express basketball as a freestyle art among their peers and against such pro immortals as Julius Erving and Wilt Chamberlain. X’s and O’s are exchanged for oohs and aahs in one of the great examples of street theater to be found in urban America.Asphalt Gods is a streetwise, supremely entertaining oral history of a tournament that has influenced everything from NBA playing style to hip-hop culture.

"Every basketball player who grew up in the 90s, at one point or another, wanted to be just like Penny Hardaway. Penny made it cool and realistic to be a guard — a point guard at that — even when you were one of the taller players on the court. Penny had it all — shooting, athleticism, ball handling, size, post game, and the attitude to dominate every night. The Penny-Shaq combination, for the very brief time it existed, was devastating and the best show in basketball. 
Injuries robbed Penny of his athletic ability and derailed his career much earlier than he should have been gone. Penny never lost his basketball IQ, however — I’ve played with and against the retired Penny and he was always the smartest player on the court, even when he didn't do much running or jumping. He jet saw the game ten steps ahead of everyone else. This Signature Workout Program, however, focuses on the in-his-prime Penny, including:
	•	Quick Shot Creating Off The Dribble 
	•	Post Scoring To Exploit Mismatches 
	•	Attacking The Rim To Finish Strong
	•	Utilizing Your Handle & Size For Midrange Scoring
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over
The NBA Signature Workouts are detailed, step-by-step 30-day self-training programs created in the mold of the abilities of your favorite NBA players. They include program overviews, mental visions, also detailed textual and video demonstration of each drill and skill. designed by YouTube star (and creator of putting basketball workouts/drills/skills online) Dre ""DreAllDay"" Baldwin. ",0.0,$19.99,Basketball,"Aug 26, 2014",913045600,WOYG Enterprises,English,Penny Hardaway Signature Workout Program,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/penny-hardaway-signature-workout/id913045600?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,30 Pages,
"Ricky Rubio is a phenom rising. At age 14 he was the youngest player ever to be drafted by the Spanish ACB League, the second-most competitive basketball league in the world.

Despite his notability, Rubio was carefully shielded from the media during his rise to stardom. Both his basketball team and his family agreed not to make him available for interviews until his 18th birthday. As a result, little is known about the personal life of young Rubio.

"Take a bunch of nice kids, dump in gobs of fiery Italian seasoning, mix in copious measures of robust Augustinian teaching, and stir gently for four years. That’s the winning recipe that transformed April Fool’s Day 1985 into a feast for underdogs and everymen everywhere. March Madness maddened to the max that year with the crowning of perhaps the NCAA Tournament’s most unlikely champion, the Villanova Wildcats. The most unlikely and perhaps the most liked team to ever win the championship, the Villanova kids won the nation over with courtesy and class more than jump shots and slam dunks.

"The Ivy League is a place where basketball is neither a pastime nor a profession. Instead, it is a true passion among players, coaches, and committed sports enthusiasts who share in its every success and setback. Outside the Limelight is the first book to look inside Ivy League basketball and at the boundless enthusiasm that defines it. With painstaking reportage, Kathy Orton vividly captures the internal fervor of the personalities who champion their gameùall the triumphs and disappointments of an Ivy hoop season. Scholarships for student athletes? None, and this is the only Division I conference that does not offer them. The TV spotlight? It barely shines, despite the passion, talent, and commitment of the players. Megadollar contracts from the NBA? Rarely does a player receive an offer. These age-old institutions are better known for turning out presidents, not point guards, and CEOs and captains of industry, not centers on the court. Orton weaves together the stories of coaches and players as they move from fall practice through an entire season and ahead to the NCAA tournament. From Harvard to Penn, Princeton to Cornell and beyond, playersùperhaps more accustomed to pomp and circumstanceùface leaky gyms, endure long bus rides, rigorous courseloads, and unbearable exam schedules. Why? Just to prove they can hang with the big boys despite juggling multiple non-athletic responsibilities? Maybe. But more importantly, for the sincere love of the game. Outside the Limelight provides frontcourt vision for college basketball fans everywhere to achieve an appreciation of this captivating conference and for diehard enthusiasts to gain greater insight into what brings Ivy League basketball to center circle.",0.0,$14.99,Basketball,"Sep 11, 2009",e-the-limelight/id998037716,Rutgers University Press,English,Outside the Limelight,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/outside-the-limelight/id998037716?mt=11,,Kathy Orton,Rutgers University Press,232 Pages,Basketball in the Ivy League

"After the 2012 season, the UConn basketball program appeared to be on the decline. Several high-profile players departed early and the NCAA confirmed that it would ban the Huskies from the 2013 NCAA tournament. But Jim Calhoun--the man who built the program in the first place--still reigned in Storrs and vowed not to leave his team in disarray. Could Calhoun save UConn basketball? He has done it before.  In twenty-five years at UConn, coach Jim Calhoun changed a team, a university, a state, and college basketball. Shock the World is a riveting season-by-season, game-by-game, and player-by-player biography of Jim Calhoun's winning program. It paints a vivid portrait of college basketball in the last twenty-five years, and highlights the challenges Calhoun overcame to become the best program builder of all time and the greatest coach of his generation. Until March 2011 only four coaches had ever won the NCAA men's basketball championship three times or more. That month, with the culmination of the famous ""March Madness,"" the University of Connecticut's Jim Calhoun became the fifth. Calhoun's Huskies show that spirit, fortitude, and perseverance are keys to winning in modern collegiate sports, just as they are the keys to overcoming challenges off the court. At the end of the 2010 season an NCAA investigation, penalties, and the small number of returning players threatened to end the Calhoun era. Despite these obstacles, Calhoun, point guard Kemba Walker, and a group of freshmen led UConn to a win at the Maui Invitational in November, and UConn became the first team to capture its conference tournament by winning five games in five days. They went on to a thrilling win in the championship, making this period in the Calhoun era one of great resilience, and an enduring monument to Husky pride.",0.0,$24.99,Sports & Outdoors,"Sep 08, 2012",561201210,Northeastern University Press,English,Shock the World,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/shock-the-world/id561201210?mt=11,,Peter F.

"Even today, 29 years after retiring from coaching basketball at UCLA, John Wooden remains America's Coach. John Wooden: An American Treasure is the definitive book on his extraordinary life, from his early years as a small-town legend from Martinsville, Indiana, and an All-American guard at Purdue to his legendary years at UCLA and the fruitful years following his retirement. Here is the story of his relationship with his late wife, Nell: their love affair for the ages, his deep depression after her death in 1985, and how his faith and his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren provided him with the reason to embrace life again. The events that led to his decision to walk away from coaching at the pinnacle of success in 1975 are explained in detail, as well as the carefully planned words he used to tell his shocked players in the locker room that he would be retiring after the NCAA Finals game in San Diego. Here are the behind-the-scenes stories of how Wooden was offered the chance to manage the Pittsburgh Pirates, how he developed his famous Pyramid of Success, and the real secret behind why his UCLA teams were able to win more consistently than any other collegiate team ever. Here are up-close, personal moments that reveal what his life is now. On the year of the 40th anniversary of his first national championship at UCLA, and more than 30 years after his autobiography, John Wooden: An American Treasure reveals why this kind, endearing, unbelievably intelligent coaching legend, even at age 94, remains one of the more fascinating, extraordinary, yet humble men of this, or any, generation.

"Resilience. It’s not just the title of Alonzo Mourning’s stirring memoir; it’s the stuff he’s made of. Whether petitioning himself into foster care as an eleven-year-old, tirelessly studying his way onto the dean’s list at Georgetown University, making it as an all-star center in the NBA, or returning to peak form after organ-transplant surgery, Mourning has shown enormous inner strength. His faith, his determination, and his courage are what have driven and sustained him throughout his extraordinary life. In 2000, Mourning was on top of the world: He had a fat new contract, an Olympic gold medal, and a second beautiful child–all that and the fame and wealth he had earned playing the game he loved. But in September of that year, he was diagnosed with a rare and fatal kidney disease. Over the next couple of years, as his health faltered, he retired, unretired, and retired again–and sought to make sense of the rest of his life. Finally in 2003, after a frantic search for a donor match, Mourning had a new kidney and a new outlook. He vowed to make this second chance count by dedicating his life to others. He resolved that he would consider the disease a blessing, a revelation of God’s plan for him. Although he battled his way back to the NBA, winning a championship with the Miami Heat in 2006, Mourning believed that the most important and fulfilling part of his life still lay ahead. Basketball, it turned out, was just the vehicle that would allow him to devote his talents and energies to a greater cause.Alonzo Mourning’s return to basketball glory, already familiar to sports fans and non-sports fans alike, has inspired millions of patients suffering from kidney disease and living with dialysis, as well as organ donors around the world. By sharing his experiences of the physical, emotional, and spiritual roller coaster of illness and recovery, Mourning hopes to deliver a message of faith and fire, hurdles and hope, trust and triumph. Resilience is a story about the meaningful everyday lessons that he longs to share and about the things that truly matter in life.From the Hardcover edition.",5.0,$11.99,Basketball,"Sep 30, 2008",420774619,Random House Publishing Group,English,Resilience,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/resilience/id420774619?mt=11,4.83333,Alonzo Mourning & Dan Wetzel,"Random House, LLC",272 Pages,"Faith, Focus, Triumph"
"It's rare to discover a candid sports autobiography-- even rare when the author is one of the most recognizable athletes in the world. But in Shaq Talks Back, Shaquille O'Neal for the first time talks frankly about his childhood, his life, his rivalries, and his career, culminating in a dramatic, behind-the-scenes account of the Los Angeles Lakers' drive to the NBA Championship.At seven feet one inch tall and 330 pounds, Shaq has always faced outsized expectations, even as a child when he towered over other kids. Shaq Talks Back is the story of how potential became reality-- how someone expected to be a champion finally learned to become one. Beginning with his memory of crying on the court after the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers, Shaq takes us back to his younger days in Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey, then to Georgia and finally to Germany, where he began to harness some of his height and strength.From there, he recounts the remarkable progress of his basketball career, changing from a big but inexperienced teenager to a dominant college and professional player. Shaq talks about:* Playing at Louisiana State University for the unpredictable coach Dale Brown* Signing the biggest rookie contract ever with the Orlando Magic-- and going to the NBA Finals for the first time* What happened next: dissention, disappointment, and his decision to leave for Los Angeles* The dysfunctional Lakers who were never able to win the big games* Dealing with egos as he finds the right chemistry with Kobe Bryant, Phil Jackson, and new additions to the team* Rivalries with Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and others* The trouble with free throws...* ""Bling-bling"" and women: the larger-than-life world of NBA players off the court* Inside the Lakers' comeback from the brink against Portland and the drive to the NBA championshipFunny, insightful, opinionated, and unexpectedly moving, Shaq Talks Back is the true voice of the NBA's best player.",0.0,$7.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Jul 01, 2014",877422439,St. Martin's Press,English,Shaq Talks Back,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/shaq-talks-back/id877422439?mt=11,,Shaquille O'Neal,"Macmillan / Holtzbrinck Publishers, LLC",250 Pages,

"Jerry Reynolds was country before country was cool. He also was part of the Sacramento Kings before that was cool. 2015 marks the team’s 30th season in California’s capital, and Jerry has been there from the start. Quietly, he has been instrumental in the team’s growth from a shoestring operation that couldn’t compete to a model NBA franchise that is always on the short list of title contenders. He has been a firsthand witness of the league’s evolution, from Bird and Magic, to Jordan, to LeBron and Yao Ming. Jerry Reynolds has been a human Swiss Army knife, serving the Kings as a scout, assistant coach, head coach, player personnel director, general manager, and television analyst. Because he has held so many positions in the Kings’ front office the last two decades, Jerry has a unique perspective on how the Kings have evolved, and he offers that perspective in Tales from the Sacramento Kings Locker Room.For those who’ve been on the Kings bandwagon only the last decade, it wasn’t always C-Webb, Peja, and Bibby. In this reissue of Reynolds Remembers, Jerry recounts the hollow feeling of putting a CBA-quality lineup on the floor for an exhibition game against the Lakers: set for the tip-off, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and . . . Randy Allen? He remembers being left to explain the Kings’ latest defeat to the media while Bill Russell snuck out the side door. But there were victories, too. He also still has a spark in his eye from trading draft rights to Billy Owens for superstar Mitch Richmond.

"South Asian American men are not usually depicted as ideal American men. They struggle against popular representations as either threatening terrorists or geeky, effeminate computer geniuses. To combat such stereotypes, some use sports as a means of performing a distinctly American masculinity. Desi Hoop Dreams focuses on South Asian-only basketball leagues common in most major U.S. and Canadian cities, to show that basketball, for these South Asian American players is not simply a whimsical hobby, but a means to navigate and express their identities in 21st century America.The participation of young men in basketball is one platform among many for performing South Asian American identity. South Asian-only leagues and tournaments become spaces in which to negotiate the relationships between masculinity, race, and nation. When faced with stereotypes that portray them as effeminate, players perform sporting feats on the court to represent themselves as athletic. And though they draw on black cultural styles, they carefully set themselves off from African American players, who are deemed “too aggressive.” Accordingly, the same categories of their own marginalization—masculinity, race, class, and sexuality—are those through which South Asian American men exclude women, queer masculinities, and working-class masculinities, along with other racialized masculinities, in their effort to lay claim to cultural citizenship.One of the first works on masculinity formation and sport participation in South Asian American communities, Desi Hoop Dreams focuses on an American popular sport to analyze the dilemma of belonging within South Asian America in particular and in the U.S. in general.",0.0,$21.99,Basketball,"Jun 26, 2015",1003456489,NYU Press,English,Desi Hoop Dreams,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/desi-hoop-dreams/id1003456489?mt=11,,Stanley I.

"Isaiah Thomas, one of the smallest players ever selected in the NBA Draft, was the last pick in 2011. Many scouts and evaluators felt Isaiah wouldn't last long in the league due to his size. He came to Sacramento, coincidentally, as an afterthought to Jimmer Fredette in that same draft class. A few short years later, its clear who has acclimated the best to the NBA game. 
You absolutely cannot excel in this league as an undersized player without an excess of heart and toughness, and Isaiah has proved to have both in spades. He has attacked the paint and finished at and around the rim as if he were 7 inches taller, and keeps defenders honest with his outside shooting. And like nay good point guard, Isaiah keeps his teammates happy by getting everyone involved. 
This Signature Workout Program will address Isiaiah’s most dominant offensive skills with the ball, including: 
Attacking The Paint Off The Dribble And Finishing Over/Around Big Defenders
Utilizing Floaters And Runners In The Lane 
Outside Shooting Off The Dribble To Keep Defenders From Sagging Back
Hesitation, Stutter And Crossover Dribbles To Keep Defenses Off Balance While Attacking

"John Wall exploded onto the scene — literally — at the tail end of his high school career by going to some camps and tournaments and wowing scouts with his athleticism. That talent and flair for the game took him through and electric season at Kentucky and to being selected the #1 overall pick in the 2010 draft. 
Wall’s game was under the microscope in his first two seasons, as any #1 pick’s performance would be, due to shaky shooting and questionable decision-making. But since returning from an injury halfway through the 2013 season, John Wall has shown marked improvement from 3 point range and his team’s performance has improved as he’s gotten better players around him. John Wall posted career bests in assists, steals and scoring in 2014.

"Out of Bounds: Inside the NBA's Culture of Rape, Violence, and Crime is a searing indictment of professional basketball players who live in a world where criminal laws and social norms don't exist, a world where they are given license to act above the law.On the court, they dazzle us with their spectacular physical feats. They generate millions of dollars of revenue for the NBA and their teams. They inspire adulation. But underneath all the glitz, the money, and alley-oops is a seamy underbelly, a rash of lawlessness that is gripping the NBA.Based on a first-of-its-kind investigation into the criminal histories of 177 NBA players from the 2001–2002 season, Out of Bounds shows that an alarming four out of every ten NBA players have a police record involving a serious crime. They are All-Stars and they are journeymen, involved in crimes ranging from armed robbery to domestic violence to gun possession to rape.Out of Bounds takes a hard look at shocking cases, with graphic accounts of physical and sexual violence and other outrageous conduct by players. In all, more than 250 people are named, including many prominent NBA players. It exposes the environment and culture that encourages such criminal behavior. It also explains the unique challenges these cases pose for law-enforcement agencies and prosecutors. And Out of Bounds takes readers inside the hidden yet critically vital role that lawyers, agents, and fame play in insulating criminally accused players from accountability.Author Jeff Benedict, an expert on athletes and crime, draws his conclusions from exhaustive research. In addition to his criminal-background checks, the author retrieved documents from law-enforcement agencies, courts, and private attorneys. He conducted more than 400 interviews with police officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, players, agents, victims, witnesses, and coaches. What emerges is a disturbing and appalling picture of men who live above the law. A seminal and important work, Out of Bounds will forever change how we look at the NBA and its stars' lives of excess and privilege.",4.0,$10.99,Basketball,"Mar 17, 2009",363688271,HarperCollins e-books,English,Out of Bounds,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/out-of-bounds/id363688271?mt=11,3.81818,Jeff Benedict,HarperCollins,304 Pages,

"Every team has at least one. That one player who’s called on to make something happen. Throughout his career on the University of Kansas basketball team, Travis Releford was that guy. So much so, in fact, that on Senior Night 2013, head coach Bill Self told the Allen Fieldhouse crowd that Releford was “the rock of our team.” In his new book, Relentless, Releford candidly describes the hard work it took on the court and in the classroom to become “the Rock of the Jayhawks.” Growing up in the inner-city— sometimes without food on the table, he became one of the most highly recruited basketball players in Kansas City history. He went from attending a predominantly white, private high school, to becoming a father while in college, to helping the Jayhawks reach the national championship game in 2012.

"Former ESPN basketball commentator Digger Phelps is regarded as one of the most charismatic and opinionated analysts in the profession. And he was the same personality during his twenty years as the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. In this book, first published in 2004, Phelps teams up with Tim Bourret and recalls the most successful period in Notre Dame basketball history. In his twenty seasons, seventeen of Phelps’s teams advanced to postseason play, including fourteen NCAA Tournament teams. In the book, Phelps recalls his initial expression of interest in Notre Dame through a 1965 letter he wrote to football coach Ara Parseghian. It recounts the scenes of his seven wins over number one-ranked teams, including the landmark game in 1974 when the Irish ended UCLA’s eighty-eight-game winning streak. Two chapters concentrate on the coach’s former Notre Dame players, concluding with the selection of his All-Digger teams. He also recalls the twenty Hall of Fame coaches he competed against, including Bobby Knight, Al McGuire, Ray Meyer, and John Wooden. Tales from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Locker Room also contains a chapter entitled Domers,” which documents Phelps’s relationships with Notre Dame coaches, administrators, and student-athletes, including Father Theodore Hesburgh, the man who made Notre Dame what it is today.",0.0,$13.99,Basketball,"Apr 07, 2015",959450055,Sports Publishing,English,Tales from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish Locker Room,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/tales-from-notre-dame-fighting/id959450055?mt=11,,Digger Phelps & Tim Bourret,"The Perseus Books Group, LLC",224 Pages,A Collection of the Greatest Fighting Irish Stories Ever Told

"College sports fans around the nation know it as the University of Missouri, the home of the Tigers. But for the legions of fans from St. Louis to Columbia, it’s simply Mizzou, and there is no better place to be on a crisp fall afternoon than Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium. Don Faurot himself, as a graduate student, helped lay the football sod in 1926, and the playing surface was named after the legendary coach in 1972. It’s where Norris Stevenson broke the color barrier in the 1950s, where Dan Devine built a national powerhouse in the 1960s, and where Al Onofrio pulled some unlikely upsets in the 1970s. Phil Bradley, Kellen Winslow, and Eric Wrighthousehold names in college and in the proscontinued to build on that foundation in the early 1980s. Hard-working players such as Corby Jones and Brock Olivo gave the football program a new spark in the 1990s.The Tigers had little tradition in basketball until Norm Stewart returned to coach his alma mater in 1967. Big men Al Eberhard and John Brown first put the program on the map in the early 1970s; then Willie Smith electrified crowds at the Hearnes Center with his prolific scoring. Highly regarded recruits Steve Stipanovich and Jon Sundvold were the pillars of a team that won four straight Big Eight championships. Players such as Doug Smith, Anthony Peeler, and Derrick Chievous took the Tigers to the top of the national rankings while rewriting the school record books.

"Amare Stoudemire was a relatively unknown player at the time of the 2002 NBA draft. Coming out of high school, he made his mark pretty quickly with the type of athleticism that had been seen from only a few players his size, ever in the NBA. STAT averaged over 20 points per game 7 times over his first 8 full seasons before injuries started to slow him down. 
Amare has come back from his setbacks, and in New York proven to be a still-capable scorer playing mostly off the bench. This Signature Workout Program addresses Amare’s best prime-years offensive abilities, including: 
	•	Attacking The Rim Aggressively Off One Dribble In The Post
	•	Face Up Midrange Shooting 
	•	Scoring In The Paint Off The Catch/No Dribbles
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over

"Derrick Rose is a collection of articles, interviews, and features that originally appeared in the Chicago Tribune, as written by the award-winning journalists who followed the Chicago Bulls superstar's yearlong saga of injury and recovery, and his short-lived return for the 2013–2014 season.Chicago's vibrant and discursive sports culture has perhaps never been more fully on display than during Derrick Rose's lost season. Following his gut-wrenching knee injury in the 2012 playoffs, Rose began the Bulls' 20122013 campaign recovering and rehabilitating, and neither team nor player definitively declared a date for his return.As rumors swirled of Rose's estimated return to a scrappy Bulls team, local fans became increasingly frustrated. Debate raged over talk radio and the blogosphere, misinformation would spread like wildfire, snappy soundbites became amplified like city air raid sirens, and grainy video clips of Rose practicing would be pored over with investigative scrutiny. This book takes readers on the 20122013 season's roller-coaster ride of speculation and hope, and concludes with the initial optimism surrounding Rose's 2013 preseason promise and the eventual devastation of his second season-ending injury.

"What can the film Hoosiers teach us about the meaning of life? How can ancient Eastern wisdom traditions, such as Taoism and Zen Buddhism, improve our jump-shots? What can the ""Zen Master"" (Phil Jackson) and the ""Big Aristotle"" (Shaquille O'Neal) teach us about sustained excellence and success? Is women's basketball ""better"" basketball? How, ethically, should one deal with a strategic cheater in pickup basketball? With NBA and NCAA team rosters constantly changing, what does it mean to play for the ""same team""? What can coaching legends Dean Smith, Rick Pitino, Pat Summitt, and Mike Krzyzewski teach us about character, achievement, and competition? What makes basketball such a beautiful game to watch and play? Basketball is now the most popular team sport in the United States; each year, more than 50 million Americans attend college and pro basketball games. When Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, first nailed two peach baskets at the opposite ends of a Springfield, Massachusetts, gym in 1891, he had little idea of how thoroughly the game would shape American -- and international -- culture. Hoops superstars such as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Yao Ming are now instantly recognized celebrities all across the planet. So what can a group of philosophers add to the understanding of basketball? It is a relatively simple game, but as Kant and Dennis Rodman liked to say, appearances can be deceiving. Coach Phil Jackson actively uses philosophy to improve player performance and to motivate and inspire his team and his fellow coaches, both on and off the court. Jackson has integrated philosophy into his coaching and his personal life so thoroughly that it is often difficult to distinguish his role as a basketball coach from his role as a philosophical guide and mentor to his players. In Basketball and Philosophy, a Dream Team of twenty-six basketball fans, most of whom also happen to be philosophers, proves that basketball is the thinking person's sport. They look at what happens when the Tao meets the hardwood as they explore the teamwork, patience, selflessness, and balanced and harmonious action that make up the art of playing basketball.",0.0,$18.99,Philosophy,"Mar 09, 2007",858904126,The University Press of Kentucky,English,Basketball and Philosophy,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/basketball-and-philosophy/id858904126?mt=11,,Jerry L.

But his journey to America—like that of his forgotten foil, 7‘1"" Wang Zhizhi—began long before he set foot on the world’s brightest athletic stage.Operation Yao Ming opens with the story of the two boys’ parents, basketball players brought together by Chinese officials intent on creating a generation of athletes who could bring glory to their resurgent motherland. Their children would have no more freedom to choose their fates. By age thirteen, Yao was pulled out of sports school to join the Shanghai Sharks pro team, following in the footsteps of Wang, then the star of the People’s Liberation Army team.

Asked by coach Billy Cunningham how he thought things would go in the playoffs, Moses said, ""Fo', fo', fo'"" - meaning, in Moses' shorthand, that he expected the Sixers to sweep each of the three series they would need to play in order to win a championship. In Pat Williams' Tales from the 76ers, the former Sixers general manager writes about those Sixers - the transcendent talents (and personalities like Julius Erving, Bobby Jones, Maurice Cheeks, and Andrew Toney) that made them special, the years of heartache that preceded the championship run, and a season that was surprisingly devoid of drama.",0.0,$9.99,Basketball,"Jan 23, 2012",680364275,Sports Publishing,English,Pat Williams' Tales from the Philadelphia 76ers: 1982-1983 NBA Champions,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/pat-williams-tales-from-philadelphia/id680364275?mt=11,,Pat Williams,"The Perseus Books Group, LLC",999 Pages,
"In the mid-1970s, the city of Boston entered a period of upheaval on both its historic cobblestone streets and its legendary parquet basketball court. The Boston Celtics’ long dominance of the NBA came to an abrupt end, and the city's image as a hub of social justice was shaken to its core. When the federal courts declared, in 1974, that the city was in violation of school desegregation rulings and would need to institute a busing program, Boston became deeply polarized.          Then, just as the city was struggling to pull itself out of economic and social turmoil, the Boston Celtics drafted a forward from Indiana State named Larry Bird. Upon the arrival of the “Hick from French Lick” to Boston in 1979, the fates of team and city were reborn. Pride, championships, reduced crime, and an economic boom re-emerged in Boston.          In Rebound!, author Michael Connelly chronicles these parallel but intertwining worlds. It is an account of a city in financial, moral, and social decline brought back to life by the re-emergence of the Boston Celtics dynasty and the return of hope, purpose, and pride to “Hub of the Universe.” Interviews with city officials, former players, and others on the frontlines provide a fascinating exploration into this tumultuous time.",4.0,$11.99,Basketball,"Nov 10, 2010",405231921,Voyageur Press,English,Rebound!,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/rebound!/id405231921?mt=11,3.77778,Michael Connelly,Quayside Publishing Group,304 Pages,"Basketball, Busing, Larry Bird, and the Rebirth of Boston"

"Joe Johnson’s first NBA team gave up on him too soon. 
Drafted by the Boston Celtics in 2010, Boston traded Joe in the middle of his rookie season to Phoenix. Pairing hop with Steve Nash a few years later, JJ blossomed into a young star and is now accepted as just a star, period, in the league. 
You might not even know what Joe Johnson’s voice sounds like, but you know his game: one of the best isolation scorers in the game for many years, a trustworthy outside shooter who also can score in the post using his size. He’s not the biggest or strongest or the most athletic player in the gym. But when the clock is winding down, Joe Johnson is the guy teammates look for. 
This Signature Workout Program focuses on a few of Joe’s best skills, including: 
	•	Attacking The Paint In Isolation From The Perimeter
	•	Post Scoring Using Your Size Advantage
	•	Quick Crossover Moves To Create Space
	•	Midrange And Long Distance Shooting Off Of 2 Dribbles Or Less
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over
The NBA Signature Workouts are detailed, step-by-step 30-day self-training programs created in the mold of the abilities of your favorite NBA players.

"The inspiring story of the most famous high school basketball coach in America.In 40 seasons as the head coach of St. Anthony High School, a private parochial school in Jersey City, New Jersey, Bob Hurley has established a standard of excellence and achievement without peer, and remarkably, he has done this at a high school with a total student body enrollment of about 230, with no gymnasium, and with an operating deficit that threatens to shut the place down each year. Hurley himself sweeps the floor before each home game. Despite the long odds against them, Hurley's teams have captured 26 state titles and four consensus national championships, all behind an astonishing career winning percentage of .905.     In Chasing Perfect, Hurley opens up his tool box and shares some of the championship strategies he's developed to help lift his players up and out of Jersey City. The narrative centerpiece will be each of St. Anthony's seven undefeated seasons, with sketch profiles of some of the most memorable players, making some of the most memorable plays in St. Anthony history. Along the way, he'll offer empowering insights to help coaches and players to elevate their games, while empowering the rest of us to walk a more purposeful path. Part memoir, part coach's notebook and part reflection on the St. Anthony players it has been Hurley's privilege to coach, Chasing Perfect will stand as a compelling barometer of life in and around the hardscrabble streets of Jersey City, set against the backdrop of one of the most enduringly competitive high school basketball programs in the country.",4.0,$13.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Mar 19, 2013",564590886,Crown/Archetype,English,Chasing Perfect,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/chasing-perfect/id564590886?mt=11,4.23077,Bob Hurley,"Random House, LLC",336 Pages,The Will to Win in Basketball and Life

"It is often said that while Dr. James Naismith invented basketball in Massachusetts, the sport was raised and ultimately came of age in the high schools of Indiana, the state where politics, religion, and sweet corn fall in line behind the game played with the round orange ball.

"Destroying a dynasty.That was the mission of Wilt Chamberlain and 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers.For eight straight years, the Boston Celtics had dominated the National Basketball Association. Each and every season during that stretch, a new NBA championship flag was hoisted to the top of the hallowed Boston Garden. No team had been able to stop them. Nobody thought any team could or would.Season of the 76ers, The Story of Wilt Chamberlain and the 1967 NBA Champion Philadelphia 76ers, chronicles the unprecedented, record-setting championship journey of the team that finally stopped the Celtics and became the new kings of the NBA. It tells the story of the legendary Chamberlain's personal triumph over Boston and their leader, Bill Russell, arch rivals who had annually thwarted Chamberlain's championship dreams and had left him branded a loser.But Chamberlain couldn't defeat the Celtics alone. He was reunited with fiery and focused Coach Alex Hannum, the only NBA coach ever to have beaten Boston for the championship. He was surrounded by the best supporting cast of his career: Hal Greer and Chet Walker, two talented offensive stars transplanted from a bygone NBA franchise; Luke Jackson, the league's first true power forward; Billy Cunningham, a sixth man loaded with instant energy and offense; Wally Jones and Larry Costello, a pair of basketball reclamation projects; and, Matty Guokas and Bill Melchionni, a couple of hometown rookies.Chamberlain remade his game, forsaking his own incredible scoring prowess in favor of handing out assists to teammates. In turn, the 76ers remade basketball history, rocketing to an unmatched 46-4 record out of the gate and not stopping until they reached 68-13, a regular season mark never previously achieved in NBA history--or even imagined back then.The book gives fans a fascinating, month-by-month look at the team's amazing season, a season that also saw Chamberlain pursued by both a rival basketball league and the heavyweight boxing champion of the world. It also recounts in vivid, play-by-play detail one of the most historic playoff series in the annals of the NBA.s20The 76ers battled the Celtics again in a much-anticipated post-season confrontation. But this time the results would be different. Amid chants of ""Boston is dead"" from the long-suffering, Celtics-hating fans at Philadelphia's Convention Hall, the 76ers won the series quickly and decisively. They went on to defeat sharp-shooting Rick Barry and the San Francisco Warriors for the NBA title.In 1995, the 76ers took their place among the top ten teams in NBA history. Season of the 76ers makes the strong case that they are the best NBA team of all time.

"Si potrebbe cominciare da quel giorno d’inverno del 1963 in cui un giovanissimo Dino si presentò al suo primo allenamento con la Ignis Varese indossando un paio di splendide Superga rosse, giusto il colore degli acerrimi rivali del Simmenthal Milano.
Oppure da quell’abbraccio al figlio Andrea, nel 1990, alla fine dello storico match in cui si affrontarono in campo da avversari: unico caso di scontro diretto fra due generazioni nella storia del basket italiano.
O ancora dalle vittorie più belle: i due “grandi Slam” (scudetto, Coppa dei Campioni, Coppa Italia e Coppa Intercontinentale), uno con Varese nel 1970, l’altro con Milano nel 1987, l’argento olimpico con la Nazionale nel 1980, l’oro europeo nel 1983.
E come dimenticare quel 5 settembre 2003, data d’ingresso di Dino nella Hall of Fame di Springfield, “l’arca della gloria del basket”?
Da qualsiasi punto si scelga di iniziare a raccontarla, la carriera di Dino Meneghin – amato follemente dai suoi tifosi, rispettato dagli avversari non solo per la sua grinta sotto canestro ma anche per le eccezionali qualità umane – resta meravigliosa, inimitabile.
Passi da gigante ci offre l’occasione di ripercorrerla per la prima volta… dall’alto, insieme con Dino, ma anche di scoprire un basket di uomini veri e ragazzi terribili, ai tempi in cui nascondere casse di vino fresco nei  bagni dei ritiri, riempire a tradimento di schiuma la vasca dell’idromassaggio e farcire le scarpe di un malcapitato compagno con la crema per i piedi erano “gesti tecnici” necessari per vincere, non meno di un terzo tempo, di un rimbalzo o di un canestro nel momento clou di una serie scudetto.",0.0,$14.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Oct 05, 2011",470485889,Rizzoli,Italian,Passi da gigante,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/passi-da-gigante/id470485889?mt=11,,Dino Meneghin,RCS Libri S.p.A.,288 Pages,La mia vita vista dall'alto

"NEW YORK TIMES bestselling author Jack McCallum (DREAM TEAM) gives an inside look at the legendary Boston Celtics during a season of change.
“One of the five best NBA books ever written.”
—Bill Simmons, ESPN
In the 1990-91 basketball season, the Boston Celtics were a team in transition, both on and off the court. Jack McCallum, also the author of the critically-acclaimed SEVEN SECONDS OR LESS, chronicled this crucial year from the back-room planning on draft day to Larry Bird’s unforgettable effort in the postseason.
With aging superstar Bird nearing the end of his career, the season was filled with glorious highs and devastating lows. McCallum gets up close and personal with the players and management from this storied franchise, showing the larger-than-life characters in a rarely-seen light. The day-to-day drama of Bird's aching back plays in concert with the drumbeat of banter from his frontcourt partner, Kevin McHale. The book reveals the deep bonds—and sometimes deeper rivalries—of the locker room, and also provides an inside look at a league that was entering its Golden Age.",0.0,$4.99,Basketball,"Oct 01, 2013",718196007,Diversion Books,English,Unfinished Business,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/unfinished-business/id718196007?mt=11,,Jack McCallum,Diversion Publishing Corp.,446 Pages,On and Off the Court with the 1990-91 Boston Celtics
"If you watch certain reality shows or pay attention to the media, you might think you know all about the private lives of professional athletes and the women with whom these celebrities are involved. The women often are portrayed as shallow gold diggers, as ""groupies"" without morals or values, or as petty schemers who cause drama. Now, author M. S. Lily Stargazer is here to tell you that those depictions are not 100 percent genuine. Not every wife or girlfriend of a pro athlete is superficial, lewd or an opportunist. Lily Stargazer knows this and can speak from a position of authority, because for over a decade, she was one of those women, in a relationship with a professional basketball player. 
Lily felt compelled to write a memoir about part of her time she spent living her life as the fiancé to an elite professional athlete.  Not only to give audiences an inside look at that life, but more to motivate and inspire those women who seek to live a celebrity life, to do otherwise.  Lily recognizes that there is a fascination with celebrity status and lives and that there are many young women idolizing celebrities for all of the wrong reasons.  Women in the media are being idolized at times for their beauty, wealth and immoral behaviors.  Lily would not like anything more than to clear the air and help some star struck young women to realize that it is not all what it seems.
Lily met Clay in college and went on to travel the world with him as he excelled in his sport. She experienced it all—the fast life, the fame, and the money—but unlike so many others who were dazzled by the glittering world of professional sports, she managed to stay grounded. She tried to help Clay keep his feet firmly planted on the ground as well—not an easy task, given the accolades and adoration that sent him soaring higher than a jump shot.
If you’re hoping for an acrimonious retelling of Lily’s time with her NBA star, or if you want a tell-all book that names names, you won’t find that here. In the Shadows of Glory … My NBA Life is more than that. It offers an in-depth, poignant account of living day to day with an NBA player—in fact, living with the NBA itself—from the perspective of ""a girl who enjoyed life and fell in love with an athlete, a basketball player."" ",0.0,$8.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Dec 26, 2012",596923160,Publish Green,English,In the Shadows of Glory...My NBA Life,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/in-shadows-glory...my-nba/id596923160?mt=11,,M.S.

"“Be like Mike?” Just about every basketball player and billions of people across the globe want to be like Mike.  The “Mike” referenced here is, of course, Michael Jordan, widely acclaimed as the greatest basketball player of all time.  Despite the desires of so many, none of us, with the possible exceptions of Lebron James and my nine-year old grandson, Eli Massaro Roy, will ever be like Mike.  This is in part because the fundamental rules of basketball are biased, favoring some such as Jordan, James, and hopefully Eli and disadvantaging others such as most of us mortals.  Put simply, the fundamental rules of basketball are decidedly political.  This book explains how and why this is so.   	Readers who know and love basketball and especially those who do not will discover much about the game they never knew.   Among the many basketball-related questions answered in the book are the following.  What rule was instituted in reaction to teams’ dangerously throwing their smaller players into the balconies overlooking most early basketball courts?  How did creative cheating help bring the dribble into the game?  What popular singer would sacrifice “ a first born or two” to be like Michael Jordan?  What is basketball’s “Bashor resiliency test?” What is a spatula pick? What key role did passionate fans have in the origins of basketball’s backboards?    	Likewise, readers who know and love politics and especially those who do not will discover much they did not know about politics.  Why are rules or laws often stretched or broken?  Why do rules become more and more complex over time?  Why is no rule or law ever neutral?  What roles did religion, law enforcement and the Progressive Movement play in the origin and development of basketball?  Why is basketball likely the elitist of all the elite professional team sports?      The book features a simple, engaging and often humorous style to expose the biased and unequal aspects of the rules of basketball.",0.0,$2.99,Basketball,"Sep 02, 2015",1044711486,BookBaby,English,Deflated Dreams,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/deflated-dreams/id1044711486?mt=11,,John Massaro,BookBaby,64 Pages,Basketball and Politics

In Indianapolis, Duke dominated Michigan State in the semifinal to reach the title game.

"As part of the acclaimed Sports Virtues series, Jim Valvano: Joyfulness discusses the struggles and triumphs of Jim Valvano’s life. As with each story in the Sports Virtues series, this book assigns a virtue to a celebrated athlete or coach, and uses that person's story to help the reader achieve that virtue for him or herself.
What emerges after reading these stories is not only a greater understanding and appreciation of the virtues that these icons needed to get through life, but also an inspiration for the reader. Each story is followed by a small quotation from literature to amplify the meaning and application of the virtue, and each story is also followed by a series of study/review questions and other interactive activities to help the reader further understand the virtue and how to achieve it.
This book is for people of all ages, but it makes for the perfect gift from parents to children or from adult mentors to their students.

Strength in Numbers. The Warriors' 2014-2015 slogan fit this championship team to a T. While they were spearheaded by NBA MVP Stephen Curry, it took a true team effort and display of depth to claim their first NBA title in four decades. Buoyed by a dominant regular season in which they won a league-leading 67 games, the Warriors throttled the NBA with an explosive yet precise offense and a versatile and stingy defense. They cruised through the first three rounds of the playoffs, only losing three games as they dispatched the Pelicans, Grizzlies and Rockets, setting up a dream NBA Finals matchup with LeBron James and the Cavaliers, where coach Steve Kerr's team overcame a 2-1 series deficit to defeat Cleveland in six games. 

Packed with unmatched analysis and dynamic color photography from the Bay Area's largest newspaper publisher, Golden Boys takes fans through the Warriors' historic journey, from Steve Kerr taking over as head coach to Klay Thompson's red-hot 37-point quarter to Stephen Curry's MVP brilliance to the final horn sounding in Cleveland. This commemorative edition also includes in-depth profiles of Curry, Kerr, Thompson, breakout star Draymond Green, gritty defender Andrew Bogut, rising talent Harrison Barnes and other fan favorites.",0.0,$9.99,Basketball,"Jun 01, 2015",1015489470,Triumph Books,English,Golden Boys,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/golden-boys/id1015489470?mt=11,,Bay Area News Group,"Chicago Review Press, Inc.

"Yanagi enquired: What did the apprentice say to you?
	Ogawa answered: He said, “May I play?”
	Yanagi said: And what did you reply?
	Ogawa whispered: I asked him politely if he could be the post.

	Many great sportsmen of the present day find that sport is a perfect technique for generating ecstatic states astonishingly similar to those reported by religious mystics. Tennis stars, Olympic hurdlers, cricketers and racing drivers are among the leading athletes who have found enlightenment through their own particular art; The joyous virtuosity of teams like the Harlem Globetrotters has demonstrated the same potential in basketball, but the theory behind the inner game of basketball comes from Japan.
	Enlightenment Through the Art of Basketball offers a striking insight into a fundamental Oriental attitude towards sport. Kendo, karate, jiu-jitsu, swordsmanship in Samurai traditions, and archery: all have texts on sudden enlightenment through practice of the sport. Hirohide Ogawa’s dicta and aphorisms on the art of basketball, edited here by his pupil S. Yanagi, constitutes the first book on the relationship of basketball with ultimate reality yet published in the West. Just as Eugen Herrigel’s Zen in the Art of Archery and the numerous works on self-defence have reached an enthusiastic public, we believe that Enlightenment Through the Art of Basketball can offer players and spectators of basketball in the West certain insights which will prove valuable not only in their sport, but also in their daily lives.
	Ogawa, a prominent Osaka basketball player, was on the verge of international honours when he abandoned the competitive sport to devote himself to the practice of private basketball. Among his most promising pupils is S. Yanagi (Sapporo). who has, with the master’s permission, selected certain basic texts and dialogues which he believes most closely represent the Ogawa approach to the art of basketball. The translations are by H. Taniguchi, James N. Delavaye, and Otis McCrail.

There he would accomplish, against enormous odds, one of the great small-town feats in Indiana basketball history. With no starters taller than 5’10"", few wins were predicted for the Spuds. Yet, after inflicting brutal preseason conditioning, employing a variety of unconventional motivational tactics, and overcoming fierce opposition, Gill molded the Spuds into a winning team that brought home the town’s first and only sectional and regional titles.

"Ray Allen will go down in history for his big game and series-saving shot in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals, but his game has been much more than just spotting up and making jumpers (though that matters a lot when discussing Jesus Shuttlesworth). 
Ray was a 20+ points-per-game scorer at his peak, an All-Star who was the #1 option for his team and one of the top minutes-per-game players in the entire NBA — which speaks to Ray’s immaculate conditioning, which has kept Ray in the League for approaching 20 seasons. Ray is the NBA’s all time leader in made 3 point shots, and has career averages of 40% shooting from 3 and just a shade under 90% from the free throw line. He was also quite athletic — probably more than many basketball fans remember him being. 
This Signature Workout Program address some of Ray Allen’s best skills from his best days, including:
	•	Deadly Accurate Outside Shooting Off The Catch Or One Dribble
	•	Midrange Shooting On Hard Closeouts 
	•	1-3 Dribble Attacks To The Basket
	•	Scoring Off The Catch And Cuts Inside The Arc
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over

"Scottie Pippen, we can be comfortable saying, is the greatest Second Banana of all time. He came into the NBA with Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls, and after a few years of growing pains, became the most devastating all-around player on the entire decade of the 90s. There were many times during the Bulls’ dynasty run when Scottie destroyed teams even more than MJ did. Together, Scottie and MJ formed the most destructive defensive tandem the NBA has ever known. 
Scottie Pippen was one of those players who could pretty much do it all: Shoot, drive, dribble, pass, defend, rebound. This Signature Workout Program will focus on some of the most-used skills of one of the best “Total-Package” players ever seen:
	•	Leading The Break And Attacking In Transition
	•	Attacking The Basket In Straight Lines — 1 Or 2 Dribbles To Finish
	•	Shooting Off 1 Or 2 Dribbles

"Non puoi pretendere di conoscere tutta la pallacanestro quando inizi ad allenare. Hai raccolto degli spezzoni qui e là: qualcosa dai coaches che hai avuto, a qualsiasi livello tu abbia giocato. Hai visto partite, ascoltato commenti, discusso con gli amici. Quello è per ora il tuo sapere, da lì bisogna partire.Ma guidare una squadra è molto di più che avere delle nozioni sul basket. E’ saper convincere, saper trasmettere, sapersi prendere la responsabilità. Se conosci la pallacanestro solo sulla carta, forse puoi fare l’opinionista, non il coach. Se non impari ad avere relazioni forti, a capire i tuoi giocatori, a gestire i momenti di crisi, se non ti confronti con la frustrazione di una sconfitta e l’entusiasmo di una vittoria, sei ancora troppo lontano dal tuo obiettivo.Noi qui vogliamo proporti un metodo molto simile a quello che usi quando compri un cellulare nuovo: le istruzioni le leggerai man mano, intanto lo accendi, prendi confidenza con le applicazioni, scegli le suonerie, telefoni, navighi su internet…Piano piano ne scopri le possibilità, e ti accorgi di funzioni che non avresti mai nemmeno immaginato, e ti viene voglia di saperne sempre di più.Vogliamo essere quel tuo amico, che senza fare il fenomeno ti dà qualche suggerimento al volo, perché magari quello smartphone l’ha già avuto, o almeno uno con lo stesso sistema operativo.Poi ognuno il cellulare lo usa come vuole, lo personalizza con la cover che gli piace di più.

"Long before The Decision,” four MVP awards, and back-to-back NBA championships with the Miami Heat, LeBron James opened the 200304 season as an untested rookie with the Cleveland Cavaliers. In Tales from the Cleveland Cavaliers Locker Room: The Rookie Season of LeBron James, first published in 2004, readers will find anecdotes about this extraordinary rookie who grew up a stone’s throw away in Akron. Fans will read about the rest of the Cavaliers, from celebrations on the day lottery luck shone upon the team and the anticipation of LeBron’s debut to disappointments like the season-opening five-game losing streak and 6-19 start; from the excitement of a young team maturing under the guidance of head coach Paul Silas to the shrewd moves of general manager Jim Paxson. There were also the moments bordering on the absurd, like the near-riot on LeBron James Bobblehead Night. And there was the heartbreaking late-season injury to a key player that likely cost the Cavs a playoff berth.Through the eyes and ears of the media, coaches, players, fans, and more, this book is a must-read for any Cavs or NBA fan. It is a whimsical reflection on the rebirth of a forlorn franchise that was quite possibly a ping-pong ball away from relocating to another state. It is a look back at how a team led by a teenage kid with remarkable skills, awesome strength, and incredible poise went from being the laughingstock of the NBA to becoming a true playoff contender.In 2014, LeBron James decided to come home.

"Butler University in Indianapolis became the smallest school in 40 years to reach the NCAA championship game. Prior to the tournament, a statistician calculated the Bulldogs as a 200-to-1 shot to win. But as fascinating as what Butler accomplished was how they did it. Underdawgs tells the incredible and uplifting story. Butler’s coach, 33-year-old Brad Stevens, looked so young he was often mistaken for one of the players, but he had quickly become one of the best coaches in the nation by employing the “Butler Way.” This philosophy of basketball and life, adopted by former coach Barry Collier, is based on five principles: humility, passion, unity, servanthood, and thankfulness. Even the most casual observer could see this in every player, on the court and off, from NBA first-round draft pick Gordon Hayward to the last guy on the bench. Butler was coming off a great 2009–10 regular season, but its longtime existence on the periphery of major college basketball fostered doubt as March Madness set in. But after two historic upsets, one of top-seeded Syracuse and another of second-seeded Kansas State, and making it to the Final Four, the Bulldogs came within the diameter of a shoelace of beating the perennial leaders of college basketball: the Duke Blue Devils. Much more than a sports story, Underdawgs is the consummate David versus Goliath tale. Despite Duke’s winning the championship, the Bulldogs proved they belonged in the game and, in the process, won the respect of people who were not even sports fans.",4.5,$13.99,Basketball,"Nov 30, 2010",392646272,Scribner,English,Underdawgs,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/underdawgs/id392646272?mt=11,4.53333,David Woods & Dick Vitale,Simon and Schuster Digital Sales Inc.,288 Pages,How Brad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs Marched Their Way to the Brink of College Basketball's National Championship
"Hailed by ESPN as the world's most famous female basketball player, Brittney Griner has been shattering stereotypes and breaking boundaries ever since she burst onto the national scene as a dunking high school phenom. Now, she shares her coming-of-age story, revealing how she found the strength to overcome bullies and to embrace her authentic self.Brittney Griner, the No. 1 pick in the 2013 WNBA Draft, is a once-in-a-generation player, possessing a combination of size and athleticism never before seen in women's basketball. But the sport's ""most transformative figure"" (Sports Illustrated) is equally famous for making headlines off the court, for speaking out on issues of gender, sexuality, body image, and self-esteem.At six foot eight with an eighty-eight-inch wingspan and a size 17 men's shoe, the Phoenix Mercury star and three-time All-American has heard every vicious insult in the book. Bullied for being different, she has endured years of taunting, from middle school to the present day. Through the highs and lows, Brittney has learned to remain true to herself, rising above the haters who try to take her down.The journey has often been lonely. Feeling uncomfortable in her own skin for much of her adolescence, Brittney struggled with anger, the Achilles heel that often got her into trouble, usually with her fists. Her transformation began when she discovered basketball in high school. ""The court has almost always been a safe place for me, a space where I can rejuvenate myself,"" she says. ""It has always been the one place I feel free.""In this heartfelt memoir, Brittney reflects on painful episodes in her life, from the confrontations she dealt with as a kid, to the infamous on-court punch she threw during her freshman season at Baylor University, to the final moments of her college career and the crushing loss to Louisville that ended her dream of back-to-back national championships. Brittney also explores her complicated relationships with two people she loves and respects—her father, Ray, and her coach at Baylor, Kim Mulkey—as well as her mixed feelings about playing for a school that has a policy against homosexuality.Here, too, are the highs: Brittney's close bonds with her mother, Sandra, and her supportive siblings and friends; her amazing accomplishments at Baylor, including the team's 74-2 record her last two seasons; her adventurous new life as a pro in the WNBA; and her distinct sense of style, exemplified by the tattoos she proudly wears. Throughout the book, Brittney describes how she came to celebrate what makes her unique—inspiring lessons she now shares with readers.Filled with all the humor and personality that Brittney Griner has become known for, In My Skin is more than a glimpse into one of the most original people in sports; it's a powerful call to readers to be true to themselves, to love who they are on the inside and out.",4.5,$11.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Apr 08, 2014",718606469,It Books,English,In My Skin,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/in-my-skin/id718606469?mt=11,4.49057,Brittney Griner & Sue Hovey,HarperCollins,224 Pages,My Life On and Off the Basketball Court
"LeBron James is a  six-foot-eight gift from the basketball heavens.  For the past three years he was the undisputed finest high school player in America.

"Mississippi State dominated Southeastern Conference basketball in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Starting in 1959, the team won four conference titles over five seasons. Yet despite earning their way, the Bulldogs remained routinely absent from NCAA tournaments. Amid a climate of fierce segregation, Mississippi refused to allow its collegiate teams to compete with integrated programs. In 1963, one team determined to compete on the national stage made state history. Led by beloved coach Babe McCarthy and supported by university students and administration, the Bulldogs made a daring and furtive trip to play Loyola's integrated team in the national tournament. Now, sports journalist Kyle Veazey vividly recounts the amazing journey of a team that refused to be hindered by the status quo.",0.0,$9.99,Basketball,"Nov 07, 2012",577214446,The History Press,English,Champions for Change,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/champions-for-change/id577214446?mt=11,,Kyle Veazey,"The History Press, INC",128 Pages,How the Mississippi State Bulldogs and Their Bold Coach Defied Segregation

Introducing Ranketology: A New Way of Determining Basketball's Greatest Player, a book based on a statistical algorithm created to determine the greatest player in the history of the NBA. Written by Johnny Carver along with the help of scholarly experts, it gives this debate a new and creative perspective. This book delves into not only the ranking that puts the NBA's greatest in order, but also gives the profiles of the careers of each of the Top 25 players. The ranking takes statistics and accolades such as NBA Finals MVPs, regular season MVPs, championships, and total career points among others to configure who has had the most accomplished career. The Top 75 list includes ten current players, including LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.

"Chicago Bulls fans thought they had it so good. From 1991 through 1993 the Bulls won three consecutive NBA titles behind the talents of Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. When Jordan retired in the fall of 1993, those fans thought the good times were over. In the fall of 1995, however, Jordan was ready to make a full return to NBA action, Pippen was still the best number-two man in basketball, and then bad-boy Dennis Rodman was signed to join the franchise that had grown to hate him. Suddenly, the Bulls had the greatest team in NBA history. Tales from the Chicago Bulls Locker Room tells some of the inside stories from that team, the one that won three more NBA titles from 1996 through 1998. Seen from the eyes of three-time NBA champion center Bill Wennington, the Bulls come to life from an insider’s point of view. Followed everywhere and talked about endlessly, the 1995-96 Bulls captured a national and international audience and continued to keep all eyes upon them for three seasons. Fans will read about some of the most famous names in basketball history. Jordan, the demanding team leader; Pippen, the true teammate; Rodman, the reckless rebounder; Toni Kukoc, the outsider; Ron Harper, the former star-turned-role player; Luc Longley, the affable Aussie; Steve Kerr, the John Paxson sequel; all playing for Phil Jackson, the Zen master coach.

"Long before the whole world knew Sarah Palin as ""Momma Grizzly,"" the handful of girls on her high school basketball team called their starting point guard Sarah ""Barracuda"" for the tenacious defense she played. Hers was the kind of determination that fit in well on a scrappy team from a small town where people were proud to call themselves Valley Trash and happy to take on the big-city schools to prove which team was really the best.As beautiful as Alaska is, it's also unforgiving. It's a place where your first mistake may be your last. When the winter comes and the nights are long and the temperatures plunge, everyone starts looking for an escape. All across Alaska, those gyms--bright and warm--become a sanctuary not only for the players but for their isolated hometowns as well.

"UNDERBELLY HOOPS covers Carson Cunningham's final season in the storied and now defunct Continental Basketball Association (CBA). In the process, it takes a sober look at minor league professional basketball, as Cunningham tries to navigate a poor relationship with his coach and yet finish his career on his own terms by playing a final season and winning a championship.
As UNDERBELLY HOOPS shows, the CBA was a realm where hopeful players desperately hung on and crusty motels might very well have no clocks. It was a place where a trainer could be ordered to fill the visiting team's cooler with warm shower water and a coach might tell a player (namely, Cunningham) that he was focusing too much on his marriage and child rather than basketball. It was also a place where entire hotel wings could become saturated with the pungent smell of marijuana. 
And yet, even as it chipped away at your dignity and made little economic sense to remain, the CBA drew you in with the allure of action and the prospect of an NBA call-up. And it could inspire, like when you and your teammates caught a rhythm that made you remember why basketball is such a beautiful game, or when you saw guys continue to strive, to persevere, even if their dreams weren't fully realized.
""The hoops answer to Ball Four. By turns funny and poignant—and always self aware—this book allows fans into the locker room and huddle, yes, but also into the cortex of a professional basketball player. If Carson Cunningham could have jumped, run and created his shot off the dribble as masterfully as he writes and observes, he'd be starring in the NBA.""

"When in 1969 the NBA sought an emblem for the league, one man was chosen above all as the icon of his sport: Jerry West. Silhouetted in white against a red-and-blue backdrop, West’s signature gait and left-handed dribble are still the NBA logo, seen on merchandise around the world.    In this marvelous book—the first biography of the basketball legend—award-winning reporter and author Roland Lazenby traces Jerry West’s brilliant career from the coalfields near Cabin Creek, West Virginia, to the bare-knuckled pre-expansion era of the NBA, from the Lakers’ Riley-Magic-Kareem Showtime era to Jackson–Kobe–Shaq teams of the early twenty-first century, and beyond. But fame was not all glory.Called “Mr. Clutch,” West was an incomparable talent—flawless on defense, possessing unmatched court vision, and the perfect jumper, unstoppable when the game was on the line. Beloved and respected by fans and fellow players alike, West was the centerpiece of Lakers teams that starred such players as Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain, and he went on to nine NBA Finals. Yet in losing eight of those series, including six in a row to the detested Boston Celtics, West became as famous for his failures as for his triumphs. And that notoriety cast long shadows over West’s life on and off the court.  Yet as the author discovered through scores of exclusive interviews with West’s teammates, colleagues, and family members, West channeled the frustration of his darkest moments into a driving force that propelled his years as an executive. And in this capacity, the success that often eluded West on the court has enabled him to reach out to successive generations of players to enrich and shape the sport in immeasurable ways.Though sometimes overshadowed by flashier peers on the court, Jerry West nevertheless stands out as the heart and soul of a league that, in fifty years, has metamorphosed from a regional sideshow into a global phenomenon. And in Jerry West, Roland Lazenby provides the ultimate story of a man who has done more to shape basketball than anyone on the planet.  From the Hardcover edition.",0.0,$14.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Feb 23, 2010",420548431,Random House Publishing Group,English,Jerry West,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/jerry-west/id420548431?mt=11,,Roland Lazenby,"Random House, LLC",448 Pages,The Life and Legend of a Basketball Icon

"Ed O'Bannon had planned to help Nevada-Las Vegas establish a basketball dynasty. The national prep player of the year in 1990, courtesy of Basketball Times, O'Bannon yearned to help the Rebels defend their NCAA title in the 1990-91 season.
Instead, twists of fate placed O'Bannon at UCLA, where through immense challenges and struggles - including his rehabilitation from a devastating knee injury whose mending would involve a complex procedure that is still considered controversial and radical today - he would wind up contributing to the richest college hoops program in the land.
He did not just lead the Bruins to the 1995 championship; he demanded it, forcing those around him to match his own fortitude, mettle, and willpower.
In the 1995 national title game against defending titlist Arkansas, in Seattle, O'Bannon led the victorious Bruins with thirty points and seventeen rebounds, and he never took a seat on the bench. In the history of the NCAA Tournament, through 2014, only Clyde Lovellette - for Kansas in 1952 - and O'Bannon have tallied at least thirty points and fifteen boards while playing all forty minutes for the winning team in a championship game.
Eleventh Heaven examines what turned O'Bannon into a ferocious leader for the ages, a pillar of the Bruins every bit as indomitable as Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton.
In the summer of 2014, O'Bannon's convictions and courage were again supremely tested as a five-year-old lawsuit, O'Bannon v. NCAA, went to trial. An epic verdict would be rendered in O'Bannon's favor. Experts would quickly tab him as the Curt Flood of college sports.
Here is the story of a kid who dreamed of fame and fortune, and became a selfless man driven to push others, a team that fed off him, and a legendary basketball program that had its luster restored because of his resolve. Coaches, teammates, and managers recall the dynamics of that team and season. It stunned O'Bannon, at times, to speak certain words that had only been feelings and thoughts that he had kept to himself for decades.
O'Bannon bared his soul to Miech, another principle figure who was there every step of the way during the scintillating 1994-95 season. Miech ventured to Thailand, Japan, the Czech Republic, New York, and many other burgs to pursue those who contributed to the last glorious chapter of Bruins basketball, to recount those days and games, and their lives since. O'Bannon detailed his life over nearly 100 hours with Miech.
That the twentieth anniversary of UCLA's last basketball title was approaching shocked those who made it happen, as did the reality of the spring of 2015 likely marking forty years with only one UCLA crown - theirs. It is the lone banner up among those ten in Pauley Pavilion's rafters not authored by legendary coach John Wooden. It mattered. Those players and coaches explain why in an explosive and revealing look at college basketball's elite institution.",0.0,$6.99,Basketball,"Sep 01, 2014",921727954,"Booklocker.com, Inc.",English,ELEVENTH HEAVEN: Ed O'Bannon and the 1995 National Basketball Champion UCLA Bruins,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/eleventh-heaven-ed-obannon/id921727954?mt=11,,Rob Miech,"BookLocker.com, Inc.",452 Pages,

"From the moment these two players took the court on opposing sides, they engaged in a fierce physical and psychological battle. Their uncommonly competitive relationship came to symbolize the most compelling rivalry in the NBA. These were the basketball epics of the 1980s — Celtics vs Lakers, East vs West, physical vs finesse, Old School vs Showtime, even white vs black. Each pushed the other to greatness — together Bird and Johnson collected eight NBA Championships, six MVP awards and helped save the floundering NBA at its most critical time. When it started they were bitter rivals, but along the way they became lifelong friends.   With intimate, fly-on-the-wall detail, When the Game Was Ours transports readers to this electric era of basketball and reveals for the first time the inner workings of two players dead set on besting one another. From the heady days of trading championships to the darker days of injury and illness, we come to understand Larry’s obsessive devotion to winning and how his demons drove him on the court. We hear him talk with candor about playing through chronic pain and its truly exacting toll. In Magic we see a young, invincible star struggle with the sting of defeat, not just as a player but as a team leader.  We are there the moment he learns he’s contracted HIV and hear in his own words how that devastating news impacted his relationships in basketball and beyond. But always, in both cases, we see them prevail.A compelling, up-close-and-personal portrait of basketball’s most inimitable duo, When the Game Was Ours is a reevaluation of three decades in counterpoint. It is also a rollicking ride through professional basketball’s best times.",4.5,$9.99,Basketball,"Nov 04, 2009",427504018,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,English,When the Game Was Ours,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/when-the-game-was-ours/id427504018?mt=11,4.46154,Larry Bird and Others,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company,352 Pages,
"Baron Davis was a super-athletic point guard back before super-athletic point guards were a normal thing to see. Exploding over power forwards and centers for highlight dunks was one thing, but when you combined the ball handling and shooting, you had an unguardable superstar player on your hands. 
So what happened to Baron? Injuries cut his care short, and hampered him much even when he was still playing. I’ve played pickup ball with some of Baron’s former teammates and they all attest: at his best, there was no point guard in the league who was a problem for Baron, on offense or defense. 
This Signature Workout Program focuses on Baron Davis at his all-str prime level, imbuing you with skills from his heyday, including: 
	•	Crossover Combination Moves To Break Down Defenders
	•	Explosive Attacking Off The Rim Off The Dribble
	•	Pullup Jump Shooting Off The Dribble 
	•	Using Your Body To Seal Off Defenders And Absorb Contact At The Basket
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
	•	That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
	•	That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over

"The images are forever etched in the minds of Arizona basketball fans, from Miles Simon falling to the court clutching the basketball as Arizona won its first and only NCAA title in 1997, to Lute Olson’s hair being mussed in the process, to Jason Terry sleeping in his uniform for four consecutive games in the middle of all the madness. All are indelible in Wildcats history as Arizona calmly drove the winding and bumpy road to the Final Four and beyond. Before Simon, Terry, and Olson, however, there were the likes of Sean Elliott, Steve Kerr, Fred Enke, and Pop McKale—all pivotal figures in Arizona’s hoops history. There were also Fred Snowden, Mo and Stewart Udall, and a host of others who helped bring prominence to a school looking for respect first in the Southwest, and then in the rest of the nation. Arizona’s rise has made them one of television’s must-see teams and one of the country’s top winning programs over the past 25 years.In Tales from the Arizona Wildcats Locker Room, author Steve Rivera takes readers back to the time when James Pierce wanted to be more of a movie idol than a coach.

"Today basketball is played “above the rim” by athletes of all backgrounds and colors. But 50 years ago it was a floor-bound game, and the opportunities it offered for African-Americans were severely limited.A key turning point was 1963, when the Loyola Ramblers of Chicago took the NCAA men’s basketball title from Cincinnati, the two-time defending champions. It was one of Chicago’s most memorable sports victories, but Ramblers reveals it was also a game for the history books because of the transgressive lineups fielded by both teams. Ramblers is an entertaining, detail-rich look back at the unlikely circumstances that led to Loyola’s historic championship and the stories of two Loyola opponents: Cincinnati and Mississippi State. Michael Lenehan’s narrative masterfully intertwines these stories in dramatic fashion, culminating with the tournament’s final game, a come-from-behind overtime upset that featured two buzzer-beating shots. While on the surface this is a book about basketball, it goes deeper to illuminate how sport in America both typifies and drives change in the broader culture. The stark social realities of the times are brought vividly to life in Lenehan’s telling, illustrating the challenges faced in teams’ efforts simply to play their game against the worthiest opponents.",0.0,$10.99,Basketball,"Feb 18, 2013",578184368,Agate Publishing,English,Ramblers,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/ramblers/id578184368?mt=11,,Michael Lenehan,"The Perseus Books Group, LLC",272 Pages,Loyola Chicago 1963 — The Team that Changed the Color of College Basketball
"Louisville's win over Michigan in the 2013 NCAA championship game was the culmination of a basketball season few Cardinal fans will ever forget, and this commemorative book takes fans through the team's amazing journey, from their ""Battle of the Bluegrass"" win over Kentucky to the final seconds in Atlanta. Led by a backcourt featuring ""Russdiculous"" Russ Smith and star point guard Peyton Siva, Coach Rick Pitino's squad dominated the Big East, winning both the regular season and Big East Tournament championships and earned the top seed in the NCAA tournament. Louisville then stormed past North Carolina A&T, Colorado State, Oregon, and Duke to reach the Final Four for the second consecutive season. Guard Kevin Ware's gruesome leg injury against Duke inspired the team's triumphant performance in the Final Four, when a comeback win over Wichita State set up the title game matchup against the Wolverines. Adding to the school's memorable season, the Louisville women's basketball team upset top-seeded Baylor and also reached the NCAA championship game. Unbreakable: Louisville's Inspired 2013 Championship Run is packed with unique analysis from the U of L's independent student newspaper, stunning action photography, and in-depth profiles of Pitino, Smith, Siva, Ware, Luke Hancock, and Gorgui Dieng.

"Sammy Wong, All-American tells the tale of an Asian basketball player’s rise and stumble. American basketball may be among the most international of team sports, yet until recently Asians were unwelcome. On his high school, college, and professional teams, Sammy isn’t given much of a chance. Then when he does get into games, he turns out to be the kind of player who can turn a losing team into a winning one.

"As part of the acclaimed Sports Virtues series, Dean Smith: Loyalty discusses the struggles and triumphs of Dean Smith’s life. As with each story in the Sports Virtues series, this book assigns a virtue to a celebrated athlete or coach, and uses that person's story to help the reader achieve that virtue for him or herself.
What emerges after reading these stories is not only a greater understanding and appreciation of the virtues that these icons needed to get through life, but also an inspiration for the reader. Each story is followed by a small quotation from literature to amplify the meaning and application of the virtue, and each story is also followed by a series of study/review questions and other interactive activities to help the reader further understand the virtue and how to achieve it.

"Heaven Is a Playground was the first book on the uniquely American phenomenon of urban basketball. Rick Telander, a photojournalist and former high school basketball player, spent part of the summer of 1973 and all of the summer of 1974 in Brooklyn living the playground life with his subjects at Foster Park in Flatbush. He slept on the floor of a park regular’s apartment, observing, questioning, traveling, playing with, and eventually coaching a ragtag group of local teenagers whose hopes of better lives were often fanatically attached to the transcendent game itself. Telander introduces us to Fly Williams, a playground legend with incredible leaping ability and self-destructive tendencies that threatened to keep him earthbound. Another standout was Albert King, a fifteen-year-old phenom whose shy, quiet demeanor masked an otherworldly talent that eventually took him to the NBA. This edition also includes Telander’s perspectives on the arrival of an NBA team in Brooklyn.

"""It wasn't a team.  It was a tent revival.""So says Pat Summitt, the legendary coach whose Tennessee Lady Vols entered the 1997-98 season aiming for an almost unprecedented ""three-peat"" of NCAA championships.  Raise the Roof takes you right inside the locker room of her amazing team, whose inspired mixture of gifted freshmen and seasoned stars produced a standard of play that would change the game of women's basketball forever.The 1997-98 season started innocently enough.  One Saturday in August, four young freshmen--Semeka Randall, Tamika Catchings, Ace Clement and Teresa Geter--arrived on the Tennessee campus to begin their college careers.  Welcoming them were a number of players from the previous year, including Chamique Holdsclaw and Kellie Jolly.  But that night, in a sign of things to come, a simple pickup game turned into an amazing display of basketball brilliance--freshmen against established players, and with barely a shot missed by either side.  Suddenly Pat Summitt glimpsed the future: fast, aggressive and hugely talented.  This might be the team she'd worked her whole career to coach.As the season got under way, other dramas unfolded.  After one emotional team meeting, Summitt realized that many on the team were playing for something more than just the glory of the game: all four freshmen, for example, came from single-parent homes, and the tough circumstances of the majority of the other players seemed to add an extra edge to their desire to win it all.  Further, Chamique Holdsclaw, widely regarded as the greatest female player ever, was being dogged by questions about turning pro--and she seemed reluctant to rule it out.  Meanwhile, another member of the team began to notice the unwelcome attentions of a fan, who soon turned out to be a full-fledged stalker.All this was behind the scenes; out on the court, the win column was swelling with every game: 8-0, 15-0, 21-0.  As 1997 turned into 1998, Pat Summitt began privately to admit that this team had changed her: these kids were so lovable, funny and eager to please that she simply had to let them into her heart.  Along the way, the Lady Vols were redefining what women were capable of, trading in old definitions of femininity for new ones--in short, they were keeping score.  And by the time they entered the NCAA Final Four tournament in Kansas City, Summitt found herself believing the impossible: despite all the distractions, the 1997-98 Lady Vols could go undefeated, and, in doing so, raise the roof off the sport of women's basketball.Packed with the excitement of a season on the brink of perfection and filled with the comedy and tragedy of one year in the life of a basketball team, Raise the Roof will have readers cheering from the bench for a team of all-conquering players and their astonishing coach.",4.5,$11.99,Basketball,"Nov 03, 1998",496137806,Crown/Archetype,English,Raise the Roof,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/raise-the-roof/id496137806?mt=11,4.55556,Pat Summitt,"Random House, LLC",304 Pages,
"A Nigerian native who emigrated to the United States at age 11, Alex Owumi’s exploits on the basketball court earned him a college scholarship to Georgetown University. Undrafted by the NBA, Owumi pursued his basketball dream overseas, eventually signing with Al-Nasr of Libya, a state-run athletic club privately funded by the family of Libyan president Muammar Qaddafi.
Owumi’s tenure with Al-Nasr was interrupted by the Libyan uprising and resulting civil war. Imprisoned in his Benghazi apartment for more than 2 weeks with no food, phone, Internet, or hope, Owumi wondered whether he would make it out of Libya alive. Despite his weakened condition and the dangers lurking in the city, he was able to escape Benghazi and flee the country. Smuggled to a refugee camp in Egypt, he was, much to his surprise, contacted by an Egyptian team seeking his services. And so, in a bizarre, storybook ending, Owumi finished the year by helping lead the team to an unlikely league championship, earning league MVP honors in the process.

"Bring a family of four to an NBA game today, and it costs around $500 to watch a bunch of seven-footers take bad shots. Perhaps the quote often attributed to P.T. Barnum is true—there really is a sucker born every minute.The NBA is in trouble. And as NBA agent Keith Glass describes it—he's part of the problem! If team owners are willing to throw millions of dollars his way for marginal players, why should he be the only one with the self-restraint to say ""no""?In his insightful, funny, and often mind-numbingly bizarre tales of life in the NBA over the last twenty- five years, Keith Glass lets it fly from half-court. He'll tell you how we got to the present state—where an agent who makes millions off the game can't sit through one; why our NBA stars couldn't capture Olympic gold; and why the game he loves is in dire need of help.Glass has seen it all as the representative of players like Mark Eaton, the seven-foot-five center found working as a mechanic because he hated basketball; Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, who converted to Islam and brought the wrath of the league upon him when he refused to stand for the National Anthem; and first-round draft pick Quincy Douby, who was forced to enter the draft before graduating from Rutgers because of the harsh NCAA rules regarding college eligibility.With informative chapters such as ""How to Feed Your Family on Only $14 Million a Year,"" ""Eighty-one Feet of White Centers,"" and ""From 6'11"" to the 7- Eleven,"" Glass shatters the myth of NBA marketing: that everything about the game is great, and that as long as the fans in the luxury boxes are happy and weighed down with expensive merchandise, all is well. But have no fear! Keith Glass doesn't preach about the evils of highlight film slam-dunks—he'll just have you falling down laughing as he flagrantly fouls the league that was once the envy of the pro sports world.",0.0,$7.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Oct 13, 2009",360604721,HarperCollins e-books,English,Taking Shots,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/taking-shots/id360604721?mt=11,,Keith Glass,HarperCollins,304 Pages,
"A sette anni si calava dal balcone della villetta dove viveva per correre verso il campetto all’aperto dei padri Stimmatini di Rieti. A nove costruiva canestri improvvisati in un parcheggio di Pistoia. A undici andava a scuola dalle suore a Reggio Emilia e giocava a biliardino. Come un qualsiasi bambino italiano.

"George Glamack was exceptional for becoming a talented athlete despite having a significant handicap. He sustained an eye injury while playing football as a youth. This resulted in farsightedness that actually prevented him from seeing the basketball goal at close range. Nevertheless he developed his game skillfully so that he led all scorers by the time he was a senior in high school in Allentown, Pennsylvania. At the University of North Carolina Glamack was an All America in both his junior and senior seasons, 1940 and 1941. He captured the Helms Athletic Award as a senior. The honor recognized him as the outstanding basketball player among all colleges in the United States. After a stint with the College All Stars in 1941, Glamack entered the U.S. Navy.

Here was the seemingly unbeatable Duke Blue Devils pitted against the first-time finalist Connecticut Huskies, and at stake was the ultimate crown: the National Championship. On that unforgettable night in St. Petersburg, Jim Calhoun and his amazing team wrote a new chapter in the storied history of the UConn Huskies program, putting the perfect exclamation point on a season to remember.But behind the high drama that fateful night in Florida lay an even more fascinating tale of one man's rise to college basketball preeminence. In Dare to Dream, the Huskies iron-willed coach, Jim Calhoun, for the first time shares his own story about his inspirational family and the tragedies they faced; about his early successful years at Northeastern, where he began to compile the first half of a unique double (he's the only coach to have won at least 250 games at two different Division I schools); and about his assumption of ultimate responsibility at the sleeping giant in Storrs, Connecticut.Along the way, Jim Calhoun paints fascinating portraits of the players who have done battle for him, and of the unsung heroes behind the scenes whose hard work and dedication to Connecticut basketball have kept the dream alive.

"This is the first book in this series of X's and O's basketball for the high school coaches. In this edition, you will find my favorite man-to-man offenses, including the highly effective FIST offense that has been my team's bread and butter man-to-man offense for over a decade. In this book you will get the step by step progressions of this offense that is designed to make an average post player shine by using five different screens across the court for each rotation through the offense.
	But the FIST offense is not all you will get in this book. You will get the basics of a numbered fast break that transitions into a secondary break that was the basis of our our offense the year we averaged 96 points per game.
	You will get three other offenses designed to get the ball inside to your post, one offense designed for a slashing wing, and another offense that uses the ""elevator screen to free up a three point shooter.
	In addition, this book details one of the best delay games I have ever seen that not only can run the clock, but score in a variety of means when the defense starts to cheat on the offense.
	Finally, I know most coaches have a variety of baseline out of bounds plays to run. Most coaches seem to play zone against the baseline out of bounds. But when they choose to go man-to-man in this situation, I teach my team only one play. It is by far the most effective man-to-man baseline out of bounds play I have ever seen.

"Andre Mills was a rising star in basketball. College recruiters were already looking at him as a sophomore in high school, and he was named as an All-Star high school basketball player. One moment his future was laid out before him and then one slam dunk later, it was all over.
When Andre came down, splintering both shin bones in a career ending injury, his world was destroyed. Diagnosed with a rare Vitamin D deficiency, Andre was suddenly a kid without a plan. He had never really cared that much about school, his education, or life beyond ball.
Quite alone, Andre had to determine the true meaning of education, family, friends, and fighting for what he wanted.
Ball is NOT Life is not only Andre's story to self-discovery but one geared toward all young adults, parents, coaches, and educators about finding real purpose in life.
In regards to life beyond sports or the entertainment industry, Andre writes:
What is worse is how many of these same kids believe the only way out of poverty is to become a rapper or professional athlete. It's all they see on TV. They rarely hear about that successful businessman or entrepreneur who rose from poverty. If they do, it's only in a newspaper in the left-hand corner on the back for no one to see.
Today, Andre is a motivational speaker, has appeared on television, radio and in print with his tremendous message to junior high, high school, and college aged teens about life, education, self-esteem, and self-worth. The creator of his own brand, Andre is once again a rising star but this time ... it's Life without Ball.",0.0,$2.99,Self-Improvement,"Apr 23, 2015",984274029,The Next Chapter Publishing,English,Ball Is Not Life,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/ball-is-not-life/id984274029?mt=11,,Andre Mills,Ingram DV LLC,84 Pages,
"""Annie was one of the best players ever. I didn't say male or female; I said ever.""—Bill Russell, former Boston Celtics playerAnn Meyers Drysdale is one of the greatest stars in the history of basketball. But her rise wasn't without controversy. Her 1979 NBA bid to play with the Indiana Pacers brought a barrage of criticism. But Ann simply wanted to play among the best. She had always competed with the guys, and she never let anyone keep her down. In You Let Some Girl Beat You? she shares her inspirational story for the first time.A female first in many categories, Meyers Drysdale was the first woman ever signed to a four-year athletic scholarship to UCLA, where she remains the only four-time Bruin basketball All American, male or female. Ann was also the only woman ever asked to compete in ABC Sports' Superstars, pitting her against elite athletes like Mark Spitz, Joe Frazier, O.J. Simpson, and Mark Gastineau.After her athletic career Ann Meyers Drysdale went on to do color commentary on all the national stations. She also married Don Drysdale, legendary pitcher and announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers, making them the first ever married couple enshrined in their respective sport's Hall of Fame. Today Ann continues to break through barriers. She is the only female vice president in the NBA (she is vice president of the Phoenix Suns), and is also the general manager of the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, which has won two WNBA championships since she took over four years ago.

Walt Whitman saw the origins of poetry as communal, oral myth making.

"College basketball and its annual March Madness extravaganza have emerged over the last three decades as one of the most popular sporting phenomena in America. Perhaps no one personifies the excitement of this tournament better than Jim Valvano, whose heavily underdog North Carolina State Wolfpack achieved the pinnacle of success in college basketball in 1983 with an unlikely run through the NCAA Tournament, culminating in an incredible one-point victory over Houston's heavily favored Phi Slamma Jamma squad in the championship game. While that Cinderella story was Valvano's only national championship, he quickly came to symbolize the exuberance and excellence of the exciting world of college basketball. Valvano transcended his sport, touching millions as he emerged as one of the most charismatic and, ultimately, courageous figures in American life who touched millions. Diagnosed with bone cancer, he joined ESPN to comment on college basketball games. Later he received the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at ESPN's first ESPY Awards, where he announced that he was starting the V Foundation for Cancer Research. Shortly after receiving the award, he died at the age of forty-seven. In I Remember Jim Valvano, he is remembered by former players, fellow coaches, a variety of other basketball experts, close associates, and many others as one of college basketball's great movers and shakers, a man with a heart as big as his popularity. Valvano's life is the classic story of courage and determination as borne out in his memorable line: Don't give up.

"Controversial, confrontational, and driven, Coach Geno Auriemma is a force to be reckoned with-and the most accomplished male coach in women's basketball today. In his relentless quest for excellence at the University of Connecticut, he has led the Huskies to five national championships.Yet his soul never rests.For Auriemma, life affords only the briefest moments of happiness-a good round of golf, forty minutes of great basketball, a day at the beach with his family, a nice glass of wine-while disaster is seemingly always waiting to strike. It's a fatalistic philosophy, a remnant of his hardscrabble early years, but it's an outlook that has driven him to unparalleled success.In this deeply personal memoir, Geno Auriemma reveals for the first time the man behind the legend. He talks candidly about his coaching style-famed for being one of the most demanding in all the sports world. He spills the beans about his stormy dealings with other coaches such as his archrival, Pat Summitt of the University of Tennessee. And with warmth and a genuine love for his champions, he writes openly about Diana Taurasi, Sue Bird, Nykesha Sales, Rebecca Lobo, Swin Cash, and all of his other UConn stars who have gone on to stellar WNBA careers.

Throughout the last 60 years, Pennsylvania has been at the forefront of the sport's evolution, supplying the world with a steady stream of stars, from Wilt Chamberlain to Kobe Bryant, who have proven to be some of the best to ever play the game.

Coming into the league as a respected but certainly not can’t miss 15th overall pick in 2011, Leonard is posed to be an All-Star heading into his next NBA season after winning Finals MVP, going head-to-head with LeBron James in a convincing Spurs series victory. 
Though just a  role player so far in San Antonio, Kawhi came alive in the second half of the Finals, playing much more assertively and looking for — and making — his shot at the behest of his coaches. One of the best all-around players in the League, Kawhi can guard 4 positions and is a do-it-all guy on offense, scoring inside and outside, rebounding and even showing off a deft passing touch.
This Signature Workout Program focus on some of Kawhi’s best offensive scoring skills, such as:
	•	Off-Catch And One-Dribble Jump Shooting 
	•	Post Scoring Using Length And Athleticism 
	•	Scoring Off Cuts And Passes With No Dribbles

"For three decades, Al McGuire was the heart and soul of college basketball, first as the street-smart head coach at Marquette University and later as the hoops-savvy television analyst whose unique mix of humor, candor, and uncanny insights brought a whole new dimension to sports broadcasting. McGuire was the consummate professional at whatever he did. Possessing an impeccable insider's knowledge of the game, he was able to communicate to viewers in ways that were as entertaining as they were informative. He made people laugh, he could laugh at himself, and his joy for the game and people in it made him one of sports' most enduring icons. McGuire passed away at the age of seventy-two in early 2001 after a long illness, leaving behind a basketball-rich legacy that had its poetic qualities as well. Never was that more evident than in the 1976-77 season, when McGuire announced to his team in midseason that it would be his last year in coaching. The season ended with McGuire overcome by emotion, sitting on the Marquette bench with tears streaming down his face as the Warriors gave their beloved coach the ultimate going-away present, a national championship. Thus ended a twenty-year coaching career in which McGuire completed a 405-143 record, including a 295-80 mark at Marquette. In I Remember Al McGuire, the legendary basketball coach and announcer is remembered by dozens of associates, who offer their favorite anecdotes, insights, assessments, and other assorted memories of a basketball junkie as quick with a quip as he was with a word of encouragement.

"Since the inception of the Atlantic Coast Conference, intense rivalries, legendary coaches, gifted players, and fervent fans have come to define the league's basketball history. In ACC Basketball, J. Samuel Walker traces the traditions and the dramatic changes that occurred both on and off the court during the conference's rise to a preeminent position in college basketball between 1953 and 1972.Walker vividly re-creates the action of nail-biting games and the tensions of bitter recruiting battles without losing sight of the central off-court questions the league wrestled with during these two decades. As basketball became the ACC's foremost attraction, conference administrators sought to field winning teams while improving academic programs and preserving academic integrity. The ACC also adapted gradually to changes in the postwar South, including, most prominently, the struggle for racial justice during the 1960s. ACC Basketball is a lively, entertaining account of coaches' flair (and antics), players' artistry, a major point-shaving scandal, and the gradually more evenly matched struggle for dominance in one of college basketball's strongest conferences.",0.0,$24.99,Basketball,"Nov 15, 2011",782291884,The University of North Carolina Press,English,ACC Basketball,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/acc-basketball/id782291884?mt=11,,J.

"Earl “The Pearl” Monroe is a basketball legend whose impact on the game transcends statistics, a player known as much for his unorthodox, “playground” style of play as his championship pedigree. Observers said that watching him play was like listening to jazz, his moves resembling free-floating improvisations. “I don’t know what I’m going to do with the ball,” Monroe once admitted, “and if I don’t know, I’m quite sure the guy guarding me doesn’t know either.”
Traded to the New York Knicks before the 1971–72 season, Monroe became a key member of the beloved, star-studded 1972–73 Knicks team that captured the NBA title. And now, on the 40th anniversary of that championship season—the franchise’s last—Monroe is finally ready to tell his remarkable story.
Written with bestselling author Quincy Troupe (Miles, The Pursuit of Happyness) Earl the Pearl will retrace Monroe’s life from his upbringing in a tough South Philadelphia neighborhood through his record-setting days at Winston-Salem State, to his NBA Rookie of the Year season in 1967, his tremendous years with the Baltimore Bullets and ultimately his redemptive, championship glory with the New York Knicks. The book will culminate with a revealing epilogue in which Monroe reflects on the events of the past 40 years, offers his insights into the NBA today, and his thoughts on the future of the game he loves.",0.0,$14.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"Apr 23, 2013",622861811,Rodale,English,Earl the Pearl,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/earl-the-pearl/id622861811?mt=11,,Earl Monroe & Quincy Troupe,Rodale Inc.,448 Pages,My Story

"In this revised and expanded edition, Los Angeles Times writer Mark Heisler investigates the 45-year history of the Los Angeles Lakers and unveils a pattern of pampered and/or misguided players, megalomaniacal executives, and owners whose obsessive drives for championships and attention combined to create an atmosphere of conflict for decades Throughout the entire 2003–04 season, fans and the media called the L.A. Lakers the biggest reality show in the country. But the laundry list of conflicts—the ongoing Kobe-Shaq bickering, Kobe's sexual assault trial, Phil Jackson's final season, Gary Payton's refusal to admit his physical decline, and the loss to Detroit in the championship—was just another year in the history of the Lakers.

"LaMarcus Aldridge never seems to grab may headlines, but he has been dutifully getting the job done at “Star” levels, going on 6 years now. 
As a player who never makes a show of himself or beats his chest for the attention of the camera, LA’s numbers rival Chris Bosh’s stats over his career, though he’s only made one All-Star game as of 2014. LaMarcus upped his rebounding and scoring averages by 2 per game in posting his first ever double-double season and joining teammate Damian Lillard in the All-Star game. 
This Signature Workout Program will focus on LaMarcus Aldridge’s best in-game skills, namely:
	•	Midrange Face-Up & Spot-Up Shooting
	•	Creating And Making Jump Shots Out Of The Low Post
	•	Driving From The Post With One Or Two Dribbles
	•	Back-To-Basket Turnaround Shooting Over Defenders
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over
The NBA Signature Workouts are detailed, step-by-step 30-day self-training programs created in the mold of the abilities of your favorite NBA players. They include program overviews, mental visions, also detailed textual and video demonstration of each drill and skill. designed by YouTube star (and creator of putting basketball workouts/drills/skills online) Dre ""DreAllDay"" Baldwin. ",0.0,$19.99,Basketball,"Aug 26, 2014",ge-signature/id913043953,WOYG Enterprises,English,LaMarcus Aldridge Signature Workout Program,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/lamarcus-aldridge-signature/id913043953?mt=11,,Dre Baldwin,Dre Baldwin,30 Pages,

"When fall rolls into winter, most sports fans in Nebraska long for spring football. But Coach Tim Miles has given hibernating fans a reason to cheer through winter for the first time in twenty years. Since taking over the men’s basketball program in 2012, Miles has gone from being relatively unknown outside college coaching circles to a big name on the national stage as an up-and-coming, funny, and fan-friendly college coach.Miles scores big with Nebraska’s fans with his social media acumen—he tweets during halftime—and his fan interaction—he applied (and failed) to become the leader of the student section at Pinnacle Bank Arena.

"In 2011, Butler University made history as the first team to make it to two consecutive finals of the NCAA basketball tournament without being seeded #1 or #2. As the smallest school to play in the championship game in the 40-year history of the tournament, Butler became the quintessential ""Cinderella"" team. How did this little-known Midwest university achieve what few schools have ever done by making it to the final championship game two years in a row.
Much of the attention is focused on head coach and team leader Brad Stevens, who was only 33 years old at the time of the 2010 tournament. Often mistaken for one of the players, Stevens coaches according to a set of six values-based principles broadly known as the Butler Way - Humility, Passion, Unity, Service, Thankfulness, and Accountability.
Through interviews with coaches, players, and alumni, M. Kent Millard explores the six leadership values taught by the entire coaching staff at Butler University. Each chapter of the book helps readers discover how these values form a solid foundation for pastors and other church leaders and anyone striving for success in life's journey.",0.0,$9.99,Christianity,"Nov 01, 2012",587856347,Abingdon Press,English,Lead Like Butler,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/lead-like-butler/id587856347?mt=11,,M.

"Imagine a boy, five feet tall and one hundred pounds, who wants to play high school basketball. Now imagine that he was blind until the age of six and that he’s the first black student to attend his suburban school. And there you have Michael Thompson in 1965 in San Bruno, California. He played at the school where a young English teacher was coaching “lightweight basketball,” a competition for smaller players that has since disappeared. The team that Coach John Christgau put together came to be called the Whiz Kids for the way they rocketed up and down the court, led by Michael and invariably winning.Michael and the Whiz Kids tells the story of the team’s 1968 championship season. It is a tale of cliffhanger games and players as outsized in character as they are short in stature, from the wild-haired, bespectacled “Professor” to the well-traveled Latvian dubbed “Suitcase” to the quiet and tenacious “Salt,” as in “of the earth.” But it is also a tale of the time—of counterculture, suburbia, integration, and racial brawls erupting on the court. In Christgau’s deft telling, it is an absorbing, often comic story of coming of age, for coach and Whiz Kids alike. ",0.0,$9.99,United States,"Nov 01, 2013",s/id714954508,UNP - Bison Original,English,Michael and the Whiz Kids,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/michael-and-the-whiz-kids/id714954508?mt=11,,John Christgau,The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska,160 Pages,"A Story of Basketball, Race, and Suburbia In the 1960s"

"""It's not every day that I'm blown away by a book about a sports figure. But MICHAEL JORDAN: THE LIFE, by Roland Lazenby, ranks up there with the very best: The Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn, Friday Night Lights by Buzz Bissinger, and Joe DiMaggio by Richard Ben Cramer. The depth of reporting, his frequent ascent into poetry, and his intelligent analysis of the life of this complicated, fascinating American icon deserve Pulitzer Prize consideration. For the first time I understand what makes Michael Jordan tick. I was captivated, fascinated and beguiled from beginning to end."" -- Peter Golenbock, New York Times-bestselling author of George and In the Country of Brooklyn The definitive biography of a legendary athleteThe Shrug. The Shot. The Flu Game. Michael Jordan is responsible for sublime moments so ingrained in sports history that they have their own names. When most people think of him, they think of his beautiful shots with the game on the line, his body totally in sync with the ball -- hitting nothing but net. But for all his greatness, this scion of a complex family from North Carolina's Coastal Plain has a darker side: he's a ruthless competitor and a lover of high stakes. There's never been a biography that encompassed the dual nature of his character and looked so deeply at Jordan on and off the court -- until now.Basketball journalist Roland Lazenby spent almost thirty years covering Michael Jordan's career in college and the pros. He witnessed Jordan's growth from a skinny rookie to the instantly recognizable global ambassador for basketball whose business savvy and success have millions of kids still wanting to be just like Mike. Yet Lazenby also witnessed the Michael Jordan whose drive and appetite are more fearsome and more insatiable than any of his fans could begin to know. Michael Jordan: The Life explores both sides of his personality to reveal the fullest, most compelling story of the man who is Michael Jordan.Lazenby draws on his personal relationships with Jordan's coaches; countless interviews with Jordan's friends, teammates, and family members; and interviews with Jordan himself to provide the first truly definitive study of Michael Jordan: the player, the icon, and the man.",3.5,$12.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"May 06, 2014",698920229,"Little, Brown and Company",English,Michael Jordan,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/michael-jordan/id698920229?mt=11,3.62963,Roland Lazenby,"Hachette Digital, Inc.",720 Pages,The Life

"Read an interview with Buzz Bissinger at hoopsaddict.com here.The SHOOTING STARS were a bunch of kids from Akron, Ohio-LeBron James and his best friends-who first met on a youth basketball team of the same name when they were ten and eleven years old. United by their love of the game and their yearning for companionship, they quickly forged a bond which would carry them through thick and thin (a lot of thin) and, at last, to the brink of a national championship.  They were a motley group who faced challenges all too typical of inner-city America. LeBron grew up without a father and had moved with his mother more than a dozen times by the age of 10. Willie McGee, the quiet one, had left both his parents behind in Chicago to be raised by his older brother in Akron. Dru Joyce was outspoken, and his dad, who was ever-present, would end up coaching all five of the boys in high school. Sian Cotton, who also played football, was the happy-go-lucky enforcer, while Romeo Travis was unhappy, bitter, even surly, until he finally opened himself up to the bond his team mates offered.  In the summer after seventh grade, the SHOOTING STARS tasted glory when they qualified for a national championship tournament in Memphis. But they lost their focus, and had to go home early. They promised each other they would stay together and do whatever it took to win a national title.  They had no idea how hard it would be to pursue that promise. In the years that followed, they would endure jealousy, hostility, exploitation, resentment from the black community (because they went to a ""white"" high school), and the consequence of their own over-confidence. Not least, they would all have to wrestle with LeBron's outsize success, which brought too much attention and even a whiff of scandal their way.

"Consistency is an underrated skill. 
It doesn't grab headlines nor draw attention to itself. Mike Conley, in terms of NBA point guards over the last 5 years, could have his picture next to the word in the dictionary of basketball. In minutes, shooting percentages, and distributing/taking care of the ball (his scoring average actually went up significantly in 2014), Mike Conley is a player whom you know exactly what you're going to get every night. And that’s a compliment of the highest order in a game where players’ performance fluctuates depending on the weather the day before. 
This Signature Workout Program focus on some of Mike’s best offensive skills, such as:
	•	Floaters And Runners In The Lane Over “Bigs”
	•	Midrange Pullup Jumper Off The Dribble
	•	Using Screens To Create Space And Shots Both Inside & Outside
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over
The NBA Signature Workouts are detailed, step-by-step 30-day self-training programs created in the mold of the abilities of your favorite NBA players.

"America's favorite sportswriter teams up with Red Auerbach, the most successful and admired coach in basketball history, to tell the best stories of a legendary life.Living legend Arnold ""Red"" Auerbach led the Boston Celtics to nine NBA championships, eight of them consecutive, during his 17 year tenure in Boston, from 1950 to 1966. The fiery coach is a unique personality; brash, opinionated, and unfailingly accurate. As a coach, he never stood still along the sidelines, and in retirement he remains a lively part of the game, still consulted by coaches, players, and general managers at age 86.For years, John Feinstein has met regularly with Red Auerbach and his friends, drawing out Red's life story in a raucous series of unforgettable sessions. From those smoke-and laughter-filled rooms come the colorful reports about all the players and coaches Red has worked with and played against over the years.

"Where were you on June 19, 1986? That's the day when--improbably--Len Bias, one of the greats of the college basketball game, a player seemingly destined for NBA stardom, died of a cocaine overdose. For the next several months, millions of Americans followed the continuing, unfolding tragedy at the University of Maryland at College Park. Six years later, where is big-time basketball--the big-money game whose vulnerabilities began to come to life with Bias's death? How far has it come in reforming itself against the abuses that contributed to the Bias tragedy? In Lenny, Lefty, and the Chancellor, Baltimore Sun reporter C. Fraser Smith answers those questions through the microcosm of the University of Maryland. He demonstrates how, despite numerous obstacles, the University of Maryland has been reforming its program during the five years since Bias's death--actually transforming it from sinkhole to national model. In so doing, Smith provides the first book to look at the problems of intercollegiate sports from the college president's perspective--a point of view crucial to getting balance reinstilled in such programs. ""From 1929, the year the Carnegie Commission issued its report on the subject, through 1991, when the Knight Commission released its report, every analyst has said that university presidents are the ones who must solve the problems of intercollegiate athletics,"" says Smith. ""My book, more than any available, carefully analyzes what presidents (such as former UM Chancellor John Slaughter) have to work with, and what they are up against."" Reliance on the presidents, Smith concludes, ""is illusory and unrealistic."" In Lenny, Lefty, and the Chancellor, Smith gets at the central issues through three main characters--each of them extraordinary and compelling. ""Clearly, Len Bias captured the imagination of the sporting world,"" says Smith. ""People still remember where they were when they heard the seemingly impossible news that Bias, just drafted the day before by the Boston Celtics, had died. Lefty Driesell, though now at James Madison University and thus somewhat out of the national spotlight, is vividly remembered by college basketball followers nationwide as a uniquely charismatic and successful coach. Chancellor John Slaughter, a black college president, is less well-known but just as interesting. His core experience as UM chancellor was built around a dead basketball superstar and a problem-plagued college basketball program, but his story is important well beyond that, because it delves into such important areas as race relations in America today."" Fully-textured and crisply written, sober yet gripping, Lenny, Lefty, and the Chancellor is a ""people and issue"" book that brings the problems of big-time college basketball down to the understandable level of the individual. ""That,"" says Smith, ""is something you can't get from a year's worth of reading dry texts and graduation statistics."" Though the book offers an insider's look at the University of Maryland, and at Maryland politics, it fits snugly into a larger and timely framework. With the Knight Commission refocusing attention on big-time basketball, the NCAA enacting new reforms pioneered at UM, and NCAA teams headed into another season, the lessons of the Len Bias tragedy at Maryland are important at the national level as well.

"MIND GAMES follows the journey of Phil Jackson to the top of basketball’s coaching hierarchy, a rise that took him from obscurity in the Continental Basketball Association to nine championship rings in the NBA. Along the way he turned multimillionaire players on to meditation, transformed the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls from a one-man show to a five-man team of domination, and after battling with Bulls management, ended one dynasty to start another on the West Coast.
Sportswriter Roland Lazenby, author of the bestselling BLOOD ON THE HORNS, reveals the fascinating story of Jackson's life, from his years with the New York Knicks under the legendary Red Holzman to his remarkable nine championships coaching first the Chicago Bulls and then the Los Angeles Lakers.
In MIND GAMES Lazenby compellingly portrays a man with a unique determination to control the competitive environment he inhabits. A clear picture of the Jackson mystique emerges: philosopher, teacher, manipulator, counselor, psychologist, shaman, champion, master of mind games.

"This big-hearted memoir by the most promising professional basketball player of his generation details his rise to NBA stardom, the terrible accident that ended his career and plunged him into a life-altering depression, and how he ultimately found his way out of the darkness.Ten years ago, Jay Williams was at the beginning of a brilliant professional basketball career. The Chicago Bulls’ top draft pick—and the second pick of the entire draft—he had the great Michael Jordan’s locker. Then he ran his high-performance motorcycle head-on into a light pole, severely damaging himself and ending his career.In this intense, hard-hitting, and deeply profound memoir, Williams talks about the accident that transformed him. Sometimes, the memories are so fresh, he feels like he’ll never escape the past. Most days, he finds a quiet peace as a commentator on ESPN and as an entrepreneur who can only look back in astonishment at his younger self—a kid who had it all, thought he was invincible, and lost everything . . . only to gain new wisdom.Williams also shares behind the scenes details of life as an All-American. He tells it straight about the scandalous recruiting process and his decision to return to Duke and Coach K—a man who taught him about accountability—to finish his education. He also speaks out about corruption—among coaches, administrators, players, and alumni—and about his time in the NBA, introducing us to a dark underworld culture in the pros: the gambling, drugs, and sex in every city, with players on every team. ",0.0,,Basketball,"Jan 26, 2016",ent/id824146153,Harper,English,Life Is Not an Accident,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/life-is-not-an-accident/id824146153?mt=11,,Jay Williams,240 Pages,English,A Memoir of Reinvention

"What readers first notice about Bill Bradley’s exceptional book about his life as a pro-athlete, key basketball player for the New York Knicks, is his incredible candor. Bradley holds nothing back--giving us the straight story, describing in full detail the physical and emotional position on the court, to what was said and how it was said, to the somewhat surreal experience of seeing and experiencing the fans in their seats as they applaud or throw things. 
Bradley’s on-court writing is as fast and direct and full of vigor as the game of basketball. The book conveys to us what it was really all about: how it felt to be him in the moment. And he succeeds. What is more striking perhaps is that Bradley balances this with his off-court writing: scenes of driving on the bus with the team through a grey downtown Cleveland as they make their way to the airport--industrial cities that have long ago burnt out, he tell us, the car wheels sucking on the wet pavement. Bradley brings life on the road as a pro-athlete to life. He writes with a directness that is fresh and unexpected. Reader’s will enjoy this key-hole view into the life of a pro-athlete: they may laugh at some of what they see, be fascinated, and by turns, be horrified.

"Monta Ellis has 10 points in the scorebook before he even walks in the gym. 
Coming into the NBA out of high school in 2005 as a second round pick, Ellis had to fight to prove himself worthy as a player in the big leagues. But prove himself, he did, showing a fare blend of quickness, power and athleticism in a lithe, 6’3” body. Despite being a bit undersized for the 2-guard position, Monta’s physical tools have allowed him to thrive as a shooting guard, averaging over 19 points per game 7 times in 10 seasons. The guy just gets buckets, by any means necessary. 
This Signature Workout Program focuses on Monta’s most deadly offensive scoring weapons, such as:
	•	One-Dribble Pullup Jumpers
	•	Using Quick Crossover Moves To Get To The Basket [BONUS: And Shooting]
	•	Attacking The Paint In Transition, Using Your Speed
	•	Scoring Off Of Cuts And Passes With Your Off-Ball Movement
*Always Remember: When you get into your games, you won’t need to have memorized anything from this program. The workouts are designed for you to absorb them into your muscle memory -- all of this Hoop Handbook becomes part of your game’s makeup through repetition. You will be using this stuff in ways you won’t ever need to plan again. 
This requires two things from you. 
• That you commit to putting in the work -- as much as you need, which you need to decide -- to make your skills “automatic”, in that you end up doing moves without premeditation. 
• That, when game time comes, you stop thinking so much. The physical work has been done. Get into your Mental Zone -- whatever that is and however you need to get into it -- and let instinct take over
The NBA Signature Workouts are detailed, step-by-step 30-day self-training programs created in the mold of the abilities of your favorite NBA players.

"This book is more than about wins and losses. It is the story of Tom Applegate, a Quaker pastor who decided he could best serve humanity by teaching in the city. Growing up in Spiceland, a small town in east central Indiana, he developed a Hoosier passion for basketball. Having very little success as a player in high school did not dampen his enthusiasm for basketball.        It is interesting, easy to read, and thought evoking. It provides a wonderful yet different perspective. As you read you become involved in the lives of the young men who played for Coach Applegate.	Living a Dream with Coach Gate is great reading material for anyone looking to accomplish their lifelong dream. The book is entertaining but still presents a very interesting story. Coach Applegate did an outstanding job of exhibiting qualities that successful coaches must possess. The chapter on the extended family was very well done and told it ""like it should be."" The line ""Success is a journey not a destination"" pretty well says it all.        Tom and Carolyn, his wife, were a wonderful team. This book describes an almost-unbelievable chain of events. It was their compassion and fundamental goodness that made it work.             To know the man makes his story more interesting. It is hard to imagine this mild-mannered individual heading up such a basketball powerhouse with so many strong-willed and high-spirited players. Once you know of his love for his fellowman, his understanding and strong values, you know why he was able to attain his dreams and successes.

"Lance Allred was probably the last person you'd expect to make it in professional sports. Not only did he grow up on a polygamist commune in Montana, he struggles with obsessive-compulsive disorder. If those hurdles to the NBA don't seem large enough, Lance is also deaf.Self-deprecating, witty, and wholly original, Longshot is the unlikely story of an unlikely athlete, who despite these factors and a lot of setbacks along the way, finally realized his dream of playing in the NBA, becoming the first legally deaf player in the league. Lance refused to let others' expectations hinder his dreams, and his refreshing sense of humor about his disability allowed him to face these setbacks without giving up. From his childhood on the commune where he was ""Mormon royalty"" (his grandfather was prophet Rulon Allred of the fundamentalist sect) to his first time picking up a basketball (eighth grade), to his clumsy efforts to build his skills while growing into his 6' 11"" frame, Longshot is a riveting account of a young man finding his purpose and letting the love of the game drive him toward his ultimate goal. Going inside the competitive world of collegiate basketball and the strange experience of playing professionally in Europe, with paychecks that never arrive and a knee injury Lance's team didn't want to cover, Longshot recounts the moment when Lance hit rock bottom. When he came back to the United States for surgery, Lance was prepared to let go of his basketball dreams and become a high school history teacher like his dad. But luckily he had an agent who didn't want to see Lance's dream die, and who found him a deal with the Idaho Stampede, an NBA Development League team in Boise. Although it was paltry pay, it was the last resort. And Lance slowly began to be noticed. Revealing the resilient heart of a young man who truly believes that it's not about failure or success but about being willing to try, Longshot is a Rudy story for a new generation, a tale of inspiration, dedication, and the power of a dream.",0.0,$12.99,Biographies & Memoirs,"May 26, 2009",360628282,HarperCollins e-books,English,Longshot,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/longshot/id360628282?mt=11,,Lance Allred,HarperCollins,272 Pages,

"PAT CONROY—AMERICA’S MOST BELOVED STORYTELLER—IS BACK!  “I was born to be a point  guard, but not a very good one. . . .There was a time in my life when I walked through  the world known to myself and others as an athlete. It was part of my own definition  of who I was and certainly the part I most respected. When I was a young man, I was  well-built and agile and ready for the rough and tumble of games, and athletics provided  the single outlet for a repressed and preternaturally shy boy to express himself  in public....I lost myself in the beauty of sport and made my family proud while  passing through the silent eye of the storm that was my childhood.”   So begins  Pat Conroy’s journey back to 1967 and his startling realization “that this season  had been seminal and easily the most consequential of my life.”  The place is the  Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, that now famous military college, and in memory  Conroy gathers around him his team to relive their few triumphs and humiliating defeats.   In a narrative that moves seamlessly between the action of the season and flashbacks  into his childhood, we see the author’s love of basketball and how crucial the role  of athlete is to all these young men who are struggling to find their own identity  and their place in the world. In fast-paced exhilarating games, readers will laugh  in delight and cry in disappointment.  But as the story continues, we gradually see  the self-professed “mediocre” athlete merge into the point guard whose spirit drives  the team.  He rallies them to play their best while closing off the shouts of “Don’ t shoot, Conroy” that come from the coach on the sidelines.  For Coach Mel Thompson  is to Conroy the undermining presence that his father had been throughout his childhood.   And in these pages finally, heartbreakingly, we learn the truth about the Great  Santini. In My Losing Season Pat Conroy has written an American classic about young  men and the bonds they form, about losing and the lessons it imparts, about finding  one’s voice and one’s self in the midst of defeat.  And in  his trademark language,  we see the young Conroy walk from his life as an athlete to the writer the world  knows him to be.
