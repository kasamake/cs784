"<p>Basketball is a game that is famous worldwide. There is no one around the world who does not know about basketball or even heard about the game. And nowadays, there are different leagues and governing bodies for the game; NBA being the most famous league and FIBA as the highest governing body. With its popularity, basketball is now being played in most parts of the worlds. The game is even included in the Olympics. <br>
Though almost everyone knows the game, not all knows about the history of basketball. Perhaps only a portion of basketball fans know how basketball really begun and where. To better understand basketball and its history, here are the few important facts about it</p>",0.0,$7.99,Basketball,"Feb 26, 2013",609025634,Lulu.com,English,About Basketball,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/about-basketball/id609025634?mt=11,,"Richard M.

"<p>Andrew Wiggins was a YouTube superstar while still a junior in high school, dunking his way to several mixtapes and highlight reels before he was even in the USA. After one year in the NCAA at Kansas, he became a #1 overall NBA Draft pick and has been handed the reigns to his team in Minnesota. <br>
After a slow start to his rookie season, Andrew began to get the ball in his hands more often and tuned those touches into higher production. With his athleticism, shooting and ball handling skills, his ceiling is high. <br>
This Signature Workout program covers some of Andrew Wiggins’ best skills, including: <br>
• Explosive One-Dribble Moves To The Basket<br>
• Triple-Threat And One-Dribble Scoring Moves From The Perimeter • Mid-Post Scoring Using Up To 2 Dribbles<br>
• Jab-Step Scoring Moves Off The Catch <br>

"<p>Since the inception of the Atlantic Coast Conference, intense rivalries, legendary coaches, gifted players, and fervent fans have come to define the league's basketball history. In <i>ACC Basketball</i>, J. Samuel Walker traces the traditions and the dramatic changes that occurred both on and off the court during the conference's rise to a preeminent position in college basketball between 1953 and 1972.<br><br>Walker vividly re-creates the action of nail-biting games and the tensions of bitter recruiting battles without losing sight of the central off-court questions the league wrestled with during these two decades. As basketball became the ACC's foremost attraction, conference administrators sought to field winning teams while improving academic programs and preserving academic integrity. The ACC also adapted gradually to changes in the postwar South, including, most prominently, the struggle for racial justice during the 1960s. <i>ACC Basketball</i> is a lively, entertaining account of coaches' flair (and antics), players' artistry, a major point-shaving scandal, and the gradually more evenly matched struggle for dominance in one of college basketball's strongest conferences.</p>",0.0,$24.99,Basketball,"Nov 15, 2011",782291884,The University of North Carolina Press,English,ACC Basketball,https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/acc-basketball/id782291884?mt=11,,J.

"<p>Al Horford has been a solid, under-appreciated, just-below-star-level player for the duration of his career. Al is a player from whom you know exactly what to expect every single game, and, his All-Star appearances notwithstanding, that consistency often gets taken for granted. <br>
Al is one of the most fundamentally sound “bigs” in the NBA, getting his points in non- flashy ways and never drawing attention to himself. Anyone who has played with or watched Al, though, knows how valuable he is to a team. <br>
Al’s Signature Workout program will add some of Al’s best skills to your game, specifically: <br>

"<p>Amare Stoudemire was a relatively unknown player at the time of the 2002 NBA draft. Coming out of high school, he made his mark pretty quickly with the type of athleticism that had been seen from only a few players his size, ever in the NBA. STAT averaged over 20 points per game 7 times over his first 8 full seasons before injuries started to slow him down. <br>
Amare has come back from his setbacks, and in New York proven to be a still-capable scorer playing mostly off the bench. This Signature Workout Program addresses Amare’s best prime-years offensive abilities, including: <br>
<b>	•	Attacking The Rim Aggressively Off One Dribble In The Post</b><br>

"<p>Non puoi pretendere di conoscere tutta la pallacanestro quando inizi ad allenare. Hai raccolto degli spezzoni qui e là: qualcosa dai coaches che hai avuto, a qualsiasi livello tu abbia giocato. Hai visto partite, ascoltato commenti, discusso con gli amici. Quello è per ora il tuo sapere, da lì bisogna partire.<br>Ma guidare una squadra è molto di più che avere delle nozioni sul basket. E’ saper convincere, saper trasmettere, sapersi prendere la responsabilità. Se conosci la pallacanestro solo sulla carta, forse puoi fare l’opinionista, non il coach. Se non impari ad avere relazioni forti, a capire i tuoi giocatori, a gestire i momenti di crisi, se non ti confronti con la frustrazione di una sconfitta e l’entusiasmo di una vittoria, sei ancora troppo lontano dal tuo obiettivo.<br>Noi qui vogliamo proporti un metodo molto simile a quello che usi quando compri un cellulare nuovo: le istruzioni le leggerai man mano, intanto lo accendi, prendi confidenza con le applicazioni, scegli le suonerie, telefoni, navighi su internet…<br>Piano piano ne scopri le possibilità, e ti accorgi di funzioni che non avresti mai nemmeno immaginato, e ti viene voglia di saperne sempre di più.<br>Vogliamo essere quel tuo amico, che senza fare il fenomeno ti dà qualche suggerimento al volo, perché magari quello smartphone l’ha già avuto, o almeno uno con lo stesso sistema operativo.<br>Poi ognuno il cellulare lo usa come vuole, lo personalizza con la cover che gli piace di più.

These and dozens of other colorfully nicknamed men are the “Asphalt Gods,” whose astounding exploits in the Rucker Tournament, often against multimillionaire NBA superstars, have made them playground divinity.

On that fabled patch of concrete, unknown players have been lighting it up for decades as they express basketball as a freestyle art among their peers and against such pro immortals as Julius Erving and Wilt Chamberlain.

"<p>This is the inspirational story of Ted Owens—still the coach with the most wins in the history of Allen Fieldhouse—from growing up as a boy on a cotton farm in Southwestern Oklahoma during the Great Depression to coaching at the highest levels of the college basketball world. “At the end of each day on the farm, we would  gure the total weight of the cotton we had pulled. We called it the “hang-up,” says Owens. One day, in a competition to see who could pull the most cotton, Owens was leading his father, who then gave him the greatest life lesson: “It’s not what you have now that is important, it’s what you have at the hang-up.” He always reminded Ted that regardless of your station in life, whether encountering di culties or enjoying success, you should never lose sight of your ultimate goals. At the age of 5, Owens made his  rst basketball goal, lifting the basketball from between his legs in an underhand scooping motion. It was at that moment that basketball became his  rst love, a feeling he still embraces today. He went on to play at the University of Oklahoma for Naismith Hall of Fame Coach Bruce Drake, and he witnessed the rise of national championship programs led by football coach Bud Wilkinson, wrestling coach Port Robertson and baseball coach Jack Baer. This book is a story of the survival of a family built upon love, sacri ce, and the importance of family strength. The book also shares the ups and downs of building a coaching career and the tale of coaching basketball at the University of Kansas for 19 seasons. Owens’ teams won 206 games in Allen Fieldhouse, a number that still leads Roy Williams (201), Bill Self and Larry Brown. He coached some of the era’s greatest players while leading the Jayhawks against Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Joe Lapchick, Henry Iba, Dean Smith, Eddie Sutton, Bob Knight and John Wooden.

Anthony Davis is the number one pick and one of the most exciting prospects of the 2012 NBA draft. He was picked by the New Orleans Hornets and is expected to take this team to new heights.<br><br>
A ridiculously skilled basketball player at 6 feet 10 inches, with the wingspan of Kevin Durant, the shooting touch and ball handling skills of a guard, as well as an intimidating defensive presence, he seems destined to be a superstar. Is he a superstar-caliber player? Is he up to the task of possibly leading a professional team? The word around the league is that he needs to grow. For the nineteen year old from southern Illinois, this should not be a problem. Growing is what he has done all his life.<br><br>
